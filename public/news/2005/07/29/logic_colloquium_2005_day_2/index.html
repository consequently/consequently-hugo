<p><em>9:25</em>: There&rsquo;s wireless access in the large lecture theatre, so I&rsquo;ll take notes and upload comments occassionally through the day.  At the moment, <a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/kolaitis/">Phokion Kolaitis</a> is <a href="/phonecam/Phokion%20Kolaitis%20giving%20his%20CSP%20Course,%20Logic%20Colloquium,%20July%2029,%202005.jpg">giving his first short course lecture</a> on constraint satisfaction problems.  So far he&rsquo;s talking about examples of CSPs (graph colourings and 3-SAT are his first examples) and he&rsquo;s just looking now at homomorphisms of relational structures, and the <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~tomas/">Feder</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/">Vardi</a> claim (<a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~tomas/constraint.ps">1993</a>) that CSPs may be idenified with (or may be represented by) the problem of whether or not there&rsquo;s a homomorphism between two relational structures.  (This bit is new to me, so I&rsquo;ll listen closely.)</p>

<p><em>11:20</em>: <a href="http://mmfd.nsu.ru/mmf/persons/gonch.htm">Sergey Goncharov</a> giving an invited lecture on &lsquo;Isomorphisms and Definable Relations on Computable Models&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s always struck me as <em>weird</em> that infinite ordinals have something to do with the characterisation of computable structures (where being computable is an essentially finitary notion in one sense &ndash; any computation process can be finitely described), but then, ordinal notations are finite too.  Sergey&rsquo;s talk is about constucting interesting structures (boolean algebras, rings etc.) that are computable, but have the Scott Rank of &omega;<sub>1</sub><sup>CK</sup> (that&rsquo;s big).  This generalises some earlier results of Makkai (who showed that there were arithmetical structures of that rank) and Knight and Sheard (who showed that there were <em>computable</em> structures with that high a rank).  Goncharov&rsquo;s results (proved by coding structures inside other structures) show how to construct familiar structures that are this complex.  A related recent preprint is <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~wcalvert/preprints/moreo1ck.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>13:13</em>: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~pezz/">Itay Ben-Yaacov</a> is on now, with the first of two classes on model theory in positive and continuous logics.  (His is the first presentation using <em><a href="http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/">beamer</a></em> &ndash; the slides look very nice indeed.  I can&rsquo;t find the slides online, but an introductory paper on the same topic was recently <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1101/1101-002.ps">published in the <em>Bulletin of Symbolic Logic</em></a>, and so can be downloaded. (Thanks, <em>BSL</em>!)</p>

<p>Itaj&rsquo;s work is interesting, because seeing odd logics motivated by mathematical considerations.  In this case, he&rsquo;s interested in <em>positive</em> logics (he likes to do without Boolean negation).  The idea is that in certain known model constructions (adding so-called &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; elements to a model), the entire first-order theory of the original model is true in the extension.  This <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> work with the addition of &lsquo;hyperimaginaries&rsquo;. (While imaginaries are  classes of tuples (modulo a definable equivalence relation on the original model &ndash; think of imaginary numbers as equivalence classes of pairs of reals), hyperimaginaries are definable classes of <em>infinite</em> tuples.)  Looking at what is preserved in model extension with hyperimaginaries, it turns out that you want to avoid Boolean negation.</p>

<p>These seem to be much more finely controlled results than the kinds of preservation under completely <em>arbitrary</em> extension discussed by <a href="http://logicandlanguage.net">Gill Russell</a> and me <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/barriers/">here</a>.  There must be interesting results involved in classifying what kinds of statements are preserved in what kinds of expansions of models.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>15:15</em>: I&rsquo;m <a href="http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005">on</a> in 15 minutes.  Wish me luck!</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Much, much later</em>: OK, the live-blogging has ceased with me giving my talk, talking to people afterwards, and then going to the contributed talks in the later afternoon in the rooms where there&rsquo;s no WiFi.  Presumably the heavy day, early mornings, late nights and being drained after giving my talk partially explain why I wasn&rsquo;t particularly good at concentrating during the all-to-short contributed talks in the afternoon.  There were some nice highlights however.  I caught up with some interesting material on fixpoint quantifiers and bisimulation quantifiers in modal logics (in a talk by Giacomo Lenzi), and in Dumitru Busneag&rsquo;s talk, I was introduced to some nice algebra: the notion of a <em>normal</em> filter in a lattice ordered non-commutative doubly residuated algebra.  It&rsquo;s a filter of which left implication is a member iff the corresponding right implication is a member.  Then for any normal filter <em>F</em> and an element <em>x</em> * <em>F</em> = <em>F</em> * <em>x</em> (<em>x</em> * <em>F</em> is the set of all <em>x</em> * <em>y</em> where <em>y</em> is in <em>F</em>, and <em>F</em> * <em>x</em> is defined similarly) just like with normal subgroups.  That&rsquo;s kind-of nice.  I&rsquo;m not sure if these filters will play quite as <em>much</em> of an important role in these algebras as normal subgroups pay in group theory, but it&rsquo;s pleasing to see the parallel.</p>

<p>Now, I need sleep.  I won&rsquo;t be <em>quite</em> as keen tomorrow in the long day sessions, as I plan to be conscious in more of the contributed sessions in the later afteroon.</p>
