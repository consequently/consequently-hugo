Keeping up the Phil Agre theme from yesterday, his <a href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/network.html">Networking on the Network</a> is a mine of useful information for anyone working in academia.  It's geared for graduate students, starting off in the wild and exciting prospect of finding their own voice and creating their own projects.  However, it's worthwhile for any of us in the game: there's nothing like making the techniques and rules of the project explicit for reflecting on them.  Rummage around in the <a href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/network.html#appendix">references</a> for more to read and inwardly digest.

It's a bit crippling if what you'd planned to do relied on being online.  On Monday afternoon, we were out completely, and connectivity was only restored late Tuesday.  Anyway, I must remember: if there is a storm, there will be network outages at Macquarie.  If there has been rain, there will be a network outage at Macquarie.  In fact, if there is any inclement weather at all, expect network outages.  This might explain your hassles in getting to this page too, as I seem to be able to browse around Macquarie at will, but it's our connection to the outside world which is as dead as a doornail.  
<p>
Anyway, I'm becoming interested in the role of reason and rhetoric (or the lack thereof) in public discourse.  This has been on my mind for some time (do you know how depressing it is, looking up the newspapers for articles reporting extended <em>reasoning</em>?  This is a regular job, digging up source materials for our <a href="http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/PHIL137/">Critical Thinking</a> unit) but the proximate cause is a neat little article by Todd Gitlin in this weekend's <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/">Herald</a>.  <a href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/">Phil Agre</a>'s material on the <a href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/rre.html">RRE</a> list is usually helpful, but I'd like more.  If any of you know of a good place to start reading up on this, please <a href="mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au">let me know</a>.  Thanks.

On a different note, get lost (or found) in an <a href="http://www.gracecathedral.org/labyrinth/il/index.shtml">online labyrinth</a>.  (Actually, it's very difficult to get lost in a labyrinth, as you will probably notice if you explore this one.)

It's one of those mixed-up sorts of days, where we remember the English conquest of our continent, and all of the good and bad consequences that has.  I've written about the <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive/#273679">unfinished business</a> between indigenous Australians and the rest of us elsewhere on these pages.
<p>  
Let me mark this day by pointing to  interesting Australians of times past who helped us <em>fly</em> in one way or another.
<ul>
<li> Countless unnamed indigenous Australians refined the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s11117.htm">boomerang</a> making it a hi-tech aerofoil by years of experimentation and innovation.  Seeing (and <em>hearing!</em>) these things in flight is an incredible experience.  I have very many happy memories of experimenting with 30cm rulers and rubber bands as a youth, attempting to construct my own approximations.  
<li> <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/opinion/opinion.jsp?id=ns22757">Lawrence Hargrave</a> experimented with flight in countless crazy ways, at Stanwell Tops, just a few hours south of here in Sydney.  He never managed truly <em>powered</em> flight, but he helped others on the way.  (He appeared on our old paper 20 dollar note, too.)

<ul>
<li> Philip Greenspun's <a href="http://www.photo.net/">photo.net</a> is a great resource for people learning photography or just wanting inspiration.  Try this <a href="http://www.photo.net/architectural/interior">guide to photographing interior architecture</a>.
<li> Read <a href="http://enterprise.sct.gu.edu.au/~sctwiseh/">Howard Wiseman</a>'s <a href="http://www.sct.gu.edu.au/~sctwiseh/DECB/DECB.html">reconstruction of the ruin and conquest of Britain from 400 A.D. to 600 A.D.</a> if you're into historical sorts of things.  It's amazing what a physicist can get up to in his spare time.
<li> For those with at least a smattering of biblical background and either the memory, the prospect, or the reality of small children, do read these <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/Newsletter/09_2000/Laws1.htm">Laws Concerning Food and Drink; Household Principles; Lamentations of the Father</a> from the <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/">Society of Biblical Liternature</a>'s <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/">Newsletter</a>.
<p>
This piece has done the rounds around a few sites I read, and people have pointed to it as a good joke.  And it is.  I think it's more, too.  There's something interestingly subsersive going on when you recast household mores as biblical law.  Something subversive about the content and significance of those biblical laws. (What are these laws?  They're the kind of thing God tells us so we can all get along in His household.)  It's almost believable too, except for when you get to the laws which involve stoning people to death rather than sending them to their bedrooms without any dessert.

I was never a great picture-taker with my little autofocus 35mm camera.  I think I know why I enjoy the digital camera much more: it's the near instant feedback.   I never shot a roll of film and got it developed within the week.  It was at least a month between the first shot in a roll of film and when I eventually saw the result.  Now I can see the result in minutes.  I can shoot at will, whatever I feel like, knowing that the only cost is the battery driving the camera.  If it is a botched shot, I won't even save it on my disk.  If it's passable, I'll save it.

anthropology if you don't have the right background to understand what follows.
<p>
So, Peter Roebuck 
<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0101/18/sport/sport8.html">thinks</a>, as I do,
that one day cricket is boring.  OK, he didn't just say that it's boring, he
said: 
<blockquote> ... it was a little bloodless. Spectators want red meat not
desiccated chicken. They want to see intemperate Vikings striding around the
field in search of blood and mayhem. They want to see danger and risk and
surprises. </blockquote>
He points out that the middle of the game is completely
predictable: 
<blockquote> Everyone knows the path an innings will take,
especially between overs 15 and 40. And the solution is simple. Cut them out.
Scriptwriters reject patches that hang heavy on an audience, a composer crosses
out movements that fall flat, a songster prunes verses that fail to ignite,
except in national anthems. Cricket must follow suit. 
</blockquote> 
Let's see this happen.  Roebuck's solution is to get one-day games over in <em>half</em> a
day.  25 overs for each side. 
<p>
I say, let's take things even further.  Why not make it seven-a-side?  (That would give the fielding 
team rather more to do, and scoring would be easier.  It would also make thowing away a wicket less 
appealing in a 25 over game.)  And then limit bowlers to 5 overs each.  (Yes, that means that at least
5 out of 7 in your team would have to bowl.  How about that?)  That would make
selecting the team rather more difficult, and would certainly force selectors,
captains and teams to be a bit more creative.  We all know that one-day cricket is a game 
for all-rounders, so let's take this to an extreme.  It's not Test cricket, so let's make 
it an interesting game in its own right. 
<p>
There.  I feel better now.   To quote another sporting/marketing phrase.  
<a href="http://www.afl.com.au/">I'd like to see that</a>.

     Seen in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16103.html">The Register</a>: "The average child sees an estimated 200,000 violent acts on TV by the time they reach 18-years-old."
<p>
According to the <a href="http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/issues/current/rfull/poa00191.html">study</a> referred to in that article,
<blockquote>
An intervention to reduce television, videotape, and video game use decreases aggressive behavior in elementary schoolchildren. These findings support the causal influences of these media on aggression and the potential benefits of reducing children's media use.
</blockquote>
That's an interesting finding.  I'd be <em>more</em> interested if there were a more comprehensive story indicating <em>how</em> exposure to media influences violent behaviour.  After all, there could be many different causal stories to tell, just as there are many different kinds of violence: there is violence as imitation; violence as a part of acquiring or defending scarce resources; violence as a factor in bullying or scapegoating; violence as a show of strength; violence simply as a part of sport or play (some of the football I played as a youth was undoubtedly <em>violent</em> but it wasn't any of the other kinds of violence I've described, for the most part).  For each different kind of violent act, media consumption could conceivably have a different role to play.  It's not a trivial issue at all, and it's one I'd love to know more about.
<p>
<em>On this topic</em>: I've found Gil Bailie's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0824516451/">Violence Unveiled</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0824516346/">Rene Girard's work</a> useful and thought provoking.  But they're just a start to understanding how violence works.

     To be sure, this is not a philosophy to be undertaken on my own power.  That power has already been abandoned in despair.  It is rather a philosophy to be practiced by Other-power, which has turned me in a completely new direction through metanoesis [repentance of thought], and has induced me to make a fresh start from the realisation of my utter helplessness... This Other-power brings about a conversion in me that heads me in a new direction along a path hitherto unknown to me...  This is what I am calling 'metanoetics', the philosophy of Other-power.  I have died to philosophy and been resurrected by <em>zange</em> [repentance].  It is not a question of simply carrying on the same philosophy I had abandoned in my despair, as if resuming a journey after a temporary interruption.  It cannot be a mere repetition without negation and change.  In the life of the spirit, 'repetition' must mean self-transcendence; 'resurrection' must mean regeneration to a new life.

     Each time I take a trip to or from the train station, the corner shop, the post office or the local caf&eacute;, my walk is punctuated by loud barking when I pass a particular door at the house on the corner of my street and the next road.  This is not just <em>any</em> barking.  It is not the affectionate "hi-I'm-here-play-with-me-do-you-have-any-food-I-want-to-be-your-friend" barking of a well-adjusted canine.  No, this is aggravated barking.  The kind of barking which can come only from a seriously agitated dog.  An inordinately disturbed dog.  A dog who lives locked up in a tiny backyard behind a terrace house.  A dog whose only opportunity for contact with the outside world is the one centimetre gap betwen the ever-locked gate and the footpath.

     Before descending into the depths of sleep, most nights I've been reading short slabs of Jared Diamond's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/970615.15shreevt.html">Guns, Germs and Steel</a>.  Diamond argues that historical differences between "development" of human societies in Eurasia, Africa, the Americas, Australia and Oceania is to be explained by a combination of factors: geography, and the availability of different plant and animal species.  The point is that these factors explain differential human social structures better than positing an undiscovered genetic difference between so called "races".  It's good reading and quite thought provoking (though I agree with Danny Yee that <a href="http://dannyreviews.com/h/Guns_Germs_Steel.html">the discussion of religion is unsatisfactory</a>).  Why did the human culture of intense food production and cultural diversification arise earliest in the aptly-named fertile crescent, and then reach north to Europe and Asia?  Why did the descendents of those cultures spread across the globe?  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317552/">Read the book</a> to get a hint of how the story might have gone, and why.  

<p>I'm reminded of the best in that <em>other</em> tradition of <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/hist-mat/">historical materialism</a>: pay close attention to the stuff of history, the very stuff of the means of production upon which a society is based.  After all, if we don't <em>eat</em> we don't contribute to most of the other beautiful and terrible things a human culture can create.
<p>
P.S.  Since when does describing something as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0393317552/customer-reviews/">politically correct</a> count as a reasoned criticism of it?  (Reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0393317552/customer-reviews/">Amazon Reviews</a> of the book is an insight into a lot of disaffection in middle America and similar cultures.)

     My <a href="http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/research/groups/logic/HHPL/">piece</a> I <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_11_01_archive/#1506173">mentioned before</a> is on its way.  It's currently 7 pages, out of around 100 or so, so I'm going OK.  It would be better if a more of those pages were <em>text</em> as opposed to <em>bibliography</em>, but it's a start.
<p>
I'll post regular "length" updates to keep me honest with how much writing I get done.

     Happy <a href="http://www.centenary.gov.au/">100th Birthday</a>, <em>Australia</em>!
<p>
See the <a href="http://www.centenary.gov.au/resources/media_centre/media.php?goodwill_id=0">list of birthday wishes</a> people have sent us.  Most of them are rather generic, diplomat-speak.  The best I've found was from <a href="http://www.centenary.gov.au/resources/media_centre/media.php?goodwill_id=48">The Captains-Regent of the Republic of San Marino</a>:
<blockquote>
The Captains-Regent of the Republic of San Marino send warmest wishes to Australia for the Centenary of the Federation celebrations and hope that Australia will long continue to enjoy peace, democracy and justice.
<p>
The Regency joins the unanimous chorus of countries that recognise the primacy of law and the principles of tolerance and commitment as the foundations of the most modern societies and conveys to the Australian people the deepest gratitude of the people of San Marino for the clear example the Federation of Australia has set as a model of peaceful development.
</blockquote>
Notable omissions are <em>Indonesia</em>, <em>Iraq</em> and <em>Israel</em> (but there's a nice <a href="http://www.centenary.gov.au/resources/media_centre/media.php?goodwill_id=23">note from Iran</a>) and as far as I can see, none of the Carribean nations sent a greeting card.  Perhaps they're <a href="http://www-aus.cricket.org/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2000/DEC/068807_CI_30DEC2000.html">smarting from the recent cricket results</a>.
