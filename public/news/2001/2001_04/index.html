<li> I never expected that starting your digestive system was so much <em>fun</em> and <em>bother</em> at the very same time.
<li> It's a little known fact that children do actually have <a href="http://www.consequently.org/zachary/day5a.jpg">instruction manuals</a>.
<li> Zack and his dad <a href="http://www.consequently.org/zachary/day6a.jpg">know how to sleep</a>.  
<li> For a short time only, photos of Zack are available up at <a href="http://www.metrophoto.com.au/grestall">www.metrophoto.com.au/grestall/</a> for your perusal, and for printing.  (Don't you want <a href="http://www.metrophoto.com.au/en/Photo/View.asp?P=23896">a picture of Zack and me</a> adorning a mousepad, or a mug?  I know I do.)
<li> The fact that I don't add daily posts about him on this website means that I'm actually spending time with him, rather than writing about him.

[Richard] Rorty sympathizes with those—like Thomas Kuhn, to take a prominent example—who have pleaded with him not to characterize their work in ways they find distorting or misleading. "It's a natural reaction," he says. "They think of themselves as having made a quite specific point, and with a wave of my hand I seem to subsume their specific point as part of some great cultural movement, or something like that. They think that it's a way of putting them in bad company and ignoring the really interesting thing they said, which my net is too gross to capture." Still, Rorty defends this tendency: "I don't see anything wrong with doing that. Regardless of how they feel about it, if you think there's a common denominator or a trend, then why not say so?"

<em>Proslogion</em> are <a
href="http://www.cla.umn.edu/jhopkins/">available online</a>.  Joy!  
<p>
Here is a snippet: <em>Chapter 2</em> of the <a
href="http://www.cla.umn.edu/jhopkins/proslogion.pdf">Proslogion</a>, which
is entitled <em>That God Truly Exists</em>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Therefore, O Lord,
You who give understanding to faith, grant me to understand to the degree
You know to be advantageous that You exist, as we believe, and that You are
what we believe You to be.  Indeed, we believe You to be something than
which nothing greater can be thought.  Or is there, then, no such nature as
You, for the Fool has said in his heart that God does not exist?  But
surely when this very same Fool hears my words "something than which
nothing greater can be thought," he understands what he hears.  And what he
understands is in his understanding, even if he does not understand it to
exist.  For that a thing is in the understanding is distinct from
understanding that this thing exists.  For example, when a painter
envisions what he is about to paint: he indeed has in his understanding
that which he has not yet made, but he does not yet understand that it
exists.  But after he has painted it: he has in his understanding that
which he has made, and he understands that it exists.  So even the Fool is
convinced that something than which nothing greater can be thought is at
least in his understanding; for when he hears of this being, he understands
what he hears, and whatever is understood is in the understanding.  But
surely that than which a greater cannot be thought cannot be only in the
understanding.  For if it were only in the understanding, it could be
thought to exist also in reality something which is greater than existing
only in the understanding.  Therefore, if that than which a greater cannot
be thought were only in the understanding, then that than which a greater
cannot be thought would be that than which a greater can be thought!  But
surely this conclusion is impossible.  Hence, without doubt, something than
which a greater cannot be thought exists both in the understanding and in
reality.  
</blockquote>
<em>That</em> is a stunning argument.

(February 2001)</div><p>After a <em>seriously</em> sleep deprived night, a visit to the Early Childhood Centre (and talking things through with an early childhood nurse) works wonders.  I'd give you a link to the <a href="http://www.ilanet.net.au/clients/marrickville/cs.htm#children">Dulwich Hill Early Childhood Centre</a>, but they're too busy actually looking after people to spend time on creating web presence.

It has been forever and a day since we last spent over an hour gently talking through issues, joys, thoughts, worries and possibilities with a health professional.  Those tax dollars used to pay for Early Childhood Centres are <em>seriously</em> effective.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just me, but I think that the meaning of the word <em>universe</em> is changing.  I think, according to what <em>used</em> to be the meaning of the word, something like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/04/13/big.bang.collision/index.html?s=8">this</a> (two "universes" colliding) would be impossible.  
<p>
Why would it be impossible?  Because the universe, whatever it is, is spatiotemporally complete.  If you (or any matter or energy) can get from point A to point B then point A and point B are in the same "universe".   
<p>
Apparently that's not what "universe" means any more.  As to what it <em>does</em> mean, neither this article, nor anything else I've seen, tells me.</p>

(February 2001)</div><p><a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i32/32b00701.htm">Here</a> is a thought-provoking article from the <a href="http://chronicle.com/">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.  The point is stated in its title.  The author, Lindsay Waters wants us to <em>Rescue Tenure From the Tyranny of the Monograph</em>.  The tagline "publish or perish" is not hyperbole.  If you don't publish (and <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html">fast</a>) you won't get hired, or if you are already hired, you don't get tenure.  If you've got tenure, you won't get promoted, and you won't get research grants, and as a result, you won't get time to do <a href="http://pluralism.pitas.com/">research</a>.  As a result, you won't publish so much.  </p>  

<p>
The reasons for this dynamic should be clear.  Academics are <em>meant</em> to be researchers, and researchers are <em>meant</em> to publish: research ought to be publically evaluated, it must appear in the public domain.  So much I agree with, wholeheartedly.  </p>

<p>
But how do you measure quality of research?  Apparently, at least if you're in the <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/">Australian higher education bureaucracy</a>, you do this by <em>quantity</em>.  This is why in every year we go through the <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/">DETYA</a>, during which each <a href="http://www.ro.mq.edu.au/">research office</a> in a university tallies up the <em>quantities</em> of research "output".  You get one point for an article in a refereed journal.  Five points for a book.  All of this goes to form the <a href="http://www.ro.mq.edu.au/Quantum/Weightings.html">research quantum</a>, which is used to calculate funding for your <a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/">university</a>, your <a href="http://www.scmp.mq.edu.au/">division</a> and your <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/">department</a>.
</p><p>
The institutional pressures are clear to everyone in the system.  Publish often.  Publish anything you can. Publish garbage if you must. Why write your entry in an encyclopedia <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-substructural">concisely</a> when making it over 4000 words would <a href="http://www.ro.mq.edu.au/Quantum/Weightings.html">increase its point score from 0.2 to 1</a>?   Had I been aware of this borderline when writing <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-substructural">that entry</a> you can be sure that I would have tried to add the extra few words to bump it over the borderline.  After all, it would have made for at least $2000 extra for my university, and thereby, my department. </p>

<p>
All of this makes for the dilution of quality.  We spend less time on producing work with bite, with a wide readership, which might make an impact, which has gone through quality control and multiple drafts, and we publish anything we can, as many times as we can get away with it.  It is not healthy for universities, and neither is it healthy for intellectual culture in general.  However, these are the boundaries which structure our working lives.</p><H3><a href="archive/2001/04/17">2001/04/17</a></H3>Take the colours of my imagination<br>

<H3><a href="archive/2001/04/02">2001/04/02</a></H3><p><img src="/images/2001-04-02.jpg "width="500" height="150" border="1"><div class="small">Letterbox #1.  (March 2001)</div></p><p>The pictures for this month are all taken on the streets of Dulwich Hill and Summer Hill, here in Sydney.</p>

<H3><a href="archive/2001/04/01">2001/04/01</a></H3><p>Where did all those entries go?  They went away, but you can still visit them, either <a href="archive/2001/03/">all at once</a>, or <a href="archive/2001/03/01">one</a> <a href="archive/2001/03/02">at</a> <a href="archive/2001/03/03">a</a> <a href="archive/2001/03/03">time</a>.  Get the hang of it?  This is not the standard, <em>last few entries on the main page</em> weblog.  It's more the <em>one page for each month</em> kind of deal. This month will be a <em>big month</em> for me, I think, but a not so big month for this place.  Enjoy the pictures to come, and the occasional update of news when I get to it.<p>

It's unfashionable to like him, but I can't help it.  I love <a href="http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/~J.Collis/RVW.html">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>' symphonies.  Call me an unthinking romantic if you must, but while plenty of composers were off <a href="http://www.musiker.at/radio/twelvetoneschools/">twelve-toning</a> (and there's some worthwhile music in that tradition) RVW was composing unfashionable, "nonintellectual" music which stands the test of time and bears his unmistakeable mark.

But then, I like <a href="http://www.reelclassics.com/Actors/Astaire/astaire.htm">Fred Astaire</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.reelclassics.com/Actresses/Ginger/ginger.htm">Ginger Rogers</a> movies too.  Perhaps I am simply an incurable romantic.
