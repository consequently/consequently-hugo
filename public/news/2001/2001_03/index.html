This <a href="images/hugme.jpg">picture</a>, which I first mentioned a few days ago, was from a collection my uncle digitised for my brother and me.  It was disconcerting to see so many pictures I hadn't seen for <em>years</em>.  Apparently, I squinted in photos 31 years ago, just as I do now.  It's apparent too (though I knew this) that my I was always close to both my <a href="images/hugme.jpg">mother</a> and to my <a href="images/grandy.jpg">maternal grandfather</a>.  What I saw most strikingly in the early pictures was the great <em>loss</em> experienced my my mother's side of the family when they pulled up roots and emigrated from Holland to Australia in the early 1950's.  Brisbane was a cultural wasteland and Australians were a little on the xenophobic side (though it helped that my family were white, of course).  Somehow, they carved a life out for themselves, and for us, and we thrived.

That wasn't the case yesterday, when a botched installation of a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/macoffice/">here unnamed mega-corporation's office suite</a> not only tied up time, but managed to fry a partition of my disk so badly that neither the friendly <em>Disk Utility</em> or the last ditch boot into single user mode and <code>fsck</code> the disk could repair the errors.

For extra bonus credits, consider L. Ron Hubbard's amazing <em><a href="http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/part14/Chp41/pg0744.html">Logics</a></em>, which is advertised as follows
<blockquote>
The Logics were written by L.Â Ron Hubbard from a summary of information which began in November of 1938 and were published in 1951. They have never varied since that time. 
The Logics form a gradient scale of association of facts necessary to understand and resolve any problem. They are used to predict behavior and clarify the entire field of thought. The Logics are a method of thinking and could be called âhow to think.â The basic common denominators of all education may be found in the Logics.

Still, I'll take Wittgenstein's <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415028256/consequentlyorg">Tractatus</A> over Hubbard's Logics any day of the week.)</p><H3><a id="24">2001/03/24</a></H3><p>Go see <a href="http://www.yolnguboy.com/">Yolngu Boy</a>.

Dear Philosopher,<br>
<br>
As we know, high-speed relativity effects are expensive to detect experimentally. 
However, in daily fluid phenomena, we can easily obtain similar Axial contractions, 
Circulating time dilations, and Virtual mass increasements. The maximum light speed in 
space is similar to the terminal propagation speed when the fabric of space is taken as a 
fluid continuum. 
<br>
Now is the turning point for philosophers to be glorified for an open-minded new approach 
upon our fundamental Nature. Early birds please view a comparison table in the following

(If you're a late arrival, <a href="/news/2001/2001_03/#11">this</a> is what I'm talking about.) I started by scratching the usual "<a href="http://www.rep.routledge.com/atoz/article/U.html">Use/Mention Distinction</a>" itch. Let's go on:
<p>
Once I scratch this itch, it becomes clear to me why fideism is
unappetising.  God in God's-self is neither an <em>assumption</em> nor a
<em>conclusion</em>.  The claim that God exists on the other hand can be a
presupposition <em>and</em> a conclusion.  The one and the same claim we
make can feature in plenty of different ways.  Take an example from the
sciences.  At different times, the idea that force was mass times
acceleration was treated as a <em>definition</em> of force and as a
wonderful <em>consequence</em> of independent definitions of "Force",
"mass" and "acceleration".  As our use of the language changes, so do the
way we treat the terms in those languages.  Language is flexible and can be 
used in many different ways.  To think that the term "God" is only 
avalable for use as an assumption, and that it can't enter into the give 
and take of the rest of our reasoning practices is to take our practices 
to be much more regimented than they actually are.
<p>
Another example.  Apparently, for the fideist, God doesn't exist.  No, I 
haven't said that correctly: apparently it's not true (or not appropriate) 
to say that God does exist, because to say that something exists is to say 
that it might have not existed.  Similarly, you can't say that it's a fact 
that there's a God, because facts are contingent.  Hmm.  OK.  Here we get a 
weird assumption from the science and philosophy of the late 19th and 
early 20th century infecting our philosophy of religion.  The weird 
assumption is that the only facts are the ways that little bits of the 
world are (an electron here, a patch of colour there...) and the things 
you can make up by piecing these little bits together.  If by "object" you 
mean "piece of the physical world or the world of phenomena" and by "fact" 
you mean "way that the physical world or the world of phenomena is 
arranged" then <em>sure</em> the existence of God isn't a fact, and God 
isn't an object.  
<p>
But that's not what I mean by these things.  All 
<em>I</em> mean by <em>fact</em> can be explained in a simple phrase: it's 
a <em>fact</em> that <em>X</em> if and only if <em>X</em>.  For whatever 
<em>X</em> you please. So, it's a fact that 2+2=4 if and only if 2+2=4.  
It's a fact that Bilbo Baggins lived in Bag End if and only if Bilbo 
Baggins lived in Bag End.  It's a fact that God predestines the righteous 
if and only if God predestines the righteous.  It's a fact that there's a 
fourfold path to enlightenment if and only if there's a fourfold path to 
enlightenment.  Whether it's contingent or not doesn't come in to it.  The 
same goes for objects.  <em>Anything</em> I can talk about is an 
<em>object</em>.   Even God.  Even Ultimate Reality.  Nothing I've said presumes that we can <em>understand</em> God, or <em>comprehend</em>ultimate reality</em> but goodness: surely it's much more likely that the creator of the universe (or the way the <em>whole universe is</em>) would be much difficult to comprehend than any of our own concepts or ideas.<H3><a id="15">2001/03/15</a></H3><img src="/images/2001-03-15.jpg "width="500" height="150" border="1"><p>You've got to admire <a href="http://www.cs.umaine.edu/~chaitin/">Gregory Chaitin</a> for the publicity he manages to garner for himself.  Apparently his work on computability and its limits is so important that he has "<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns22811">shattered mathematics with a single number</a>".   Apparently, he's revolutionised the field of mathematics like so:
<blockquote>
TWO plus two equals four: nobody would argue with that. Mathematicians can rigorously prove sums like this, and many other things besides. The language of maths allows them to provide neatly ordered ways to describe everything that happens in the world around us. 

Or so they once thought. Gregory Chaitin ... has shown that mathematicians can't actually prove very much at all. (Marcus Chown in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns22811">New Scientist</a>)
</blockquote>
Of course, he's done <em>nothing</em> of the sort.  Nothing already proved by mathematicians has been overturned.  The hordes of theorems proved in the <a href="http://e-math.ams.org/mathscinet/search">acres of pages of journals</a> (let alone all of those <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/">on the net</a>) are not suddenly obselete.  The potential countable infinity of provable mathematical claims has not <em>shrunk</em> overnight.
<p>
And the fact that there's plenty in the remit of mathematics which <em>cannot</em> be proved is not new with Chaitin either.  G&ouml;del managed that fine on his own.  Yes, Chaitin manages to tie this in with his idiosyncratic definition of randomness and to prove nice things about certain numbers, such as his <em>Omega</em>.  Good luck to him with it.  But please, reporters, tone down the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns22811">fanfare</a>.

I am very worried about <a href="http://www.incredimail.com/english/splash.html">this</a> program.  Please don't send me mail with it.  Please.  Text is your friend.  Sentences are good things.  Bandwidth sucking images are not a good idea for email.  Neither are sounds.  <H3><a id="13">2001/03/13</a></H3><img src="/images/2001-03-13.jpg "width="500" height="150" border="1"><p><a href="http://www.austethical.com.au/">Australian Ethical Investment</a> seem to be doing Good Things with money.  </p><H3><a id="12">2001/03/12</a></H3>I <a href="http://consequently.org/archives/2001/03/11">promised</a> an
explanation of why I found <a
href="http://consequently.org/archives/2001/03/11">Wittgensteinian
fideism</a> in philosophy of religion unappetising.  Here it is.  <p>
<em>Unappetising</em> is a good word for the view.  There's value and
insight in it, but on it's own, it doesn't make for a satsfying meal.  It's
revealing and important to understand our conception of God (or of whatever
we take to be ultimately real) to be formed by the way we use words,
concepts and images.  That's a deep and important insight.  What happens
when people convert?  They learn to use a language.  (Among other things.) 
Some people don't have competence in the language and don't share in the
way of life, and as a result we say that they don't know what we mean.
<p>
So far, so good.  But the step from there to full-blown fideism (that there can 
be no evidence for or against religious claims, there can be no reasons 
for or against religious claims, etc.) is a mighty big one.  
<p>
First, I want to scratch an itch I feel whenever I read passages like <a 
href="http://consequently.org/archives/2001/03/11">these</a>.  Given my 
training, it bugs me whenever I see people slipping happily from talking 
about <em>things</em> to talking about <em>words</em> or <em>concepts</em> for 
things.  When Messer writes "God is a presupposition, not a conclusion", I 
feel like shaking him and saying, no, for religious believers, God is the 
creator of the heavens and the earth and is neither a presupposition nor a 
conclusion.  The <em>idea</em> of God or the <em>concept</em> of God might 
be found at the conclusion of an argument, or might be the kind of thing we 
can presuppose or assume.  God in God's-self is none of those things.   
So, when I read Messer, I need to insert mental quote marks as we jump from 
talking about God to talking about our ideas of God or our claims about 
God or whatever. 
<p>
Now, this <em>might</em> be a trivial matter.  Perhaps Messer is just 
better at mentally jumping levels than I am.  But maybe he's not.  There 
have been enough people in the grip of an idealism (that everything is an idea) 
or a projectionism about God (that God is a projection of human wishes or hopes 
or fears) for me to think that in this ballpark it's better to be clearer 
about these things than not.  After all, even if you're an idealist, you're 
probably going to want to distinguish yourself from my idea of you; from 
Inspector Moriarty and my idea of him.   Perhaps we ought to extend the same 
courtesy to God.

spew forth some of my thoughts about arguments for the existence of God.  
Let me start by quoting you some of Alex Messer's summaries of the 
classical Wittgensteinian position about belief in God.  It all comes from 
his <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198269714/consequentlyorg">Does 
God's Existence Need Proof?</a>  Here are his nice summaries of the position:
<p>

<b>God is inexpressible</b>
<blockquote>
The Wittgensteinian school is wholly opposed not only to the traditional 
definition of God, but also the whole idea of any definition of God.  
Defining God brings him within the boundaries of language rather than 
allowing him his proper place on the boundaries.  To express God is to fail 
to give due respect to the inexpressible.
<p>
page 22
</blockquote>

<b>God is not an existent or a being</b>
<blockquote>
The Wittgensteinian school is concerned to show the grammatical 
inappropriateness of treating God (as traditional philosophy has done) as 
an existent among existents.  Phillips, for example, often quotes 
Kierkegaard's dictum, 'God does not exist; he is eternal', with approval.  
The point is that to tread God as an existent is to imply that God might 
not have existed, and this is clearly not what believers have wanted to 
say at all.  For any existing thing, it makes sense to suppose that it 
might not have existed.  All people depend upon their parents having met, 
and their grandparents, and so on.  All living creatures are equally 
dependent.    All man-made objects depend for their existence upon 
geographical, geological, and biological factors.  The point is that it is 
to impose an alien grammar upon God to bring him within this realm of 
discourse.  God does not depend for his existence upon anything else; 
therefore he cannot be described as an existent ot being.
<p>
pages 23 and 24
</blockquote>

<b>God is not a matter of fact</b>
<blockquote>
It is just as grammatically confused to treat God as a fact as to treat 
God as an existent, and for the same reason.  Facts are contingent: they 
are true, but they might not have been.  God, however, cannot be spoken of 
as existing contingently, and this means that we cannot speak of God's 
reality as factual.  Facts can change: we can come to find that, because of 
new evidence, what we thought of as a fact was mistaken.  Yet it makes no 
sense to say that belief in God was mistaken because new facts have been 
discovered to show this.  To come to believe in God ... is not to discover 
a new fact -- that there is a God -- but to change one's life in a 
fundamental and practical manner.
<p>
page 25
</blockquote>

<b>God is practical, not hypothetical</b>
<blockquote>
The Wittgensteinian school rejects the notion that God is an explanation 
of life in the way that a hypothesis is.  If new evidence tomes to light 
to show that the Big Bang theory, or neo-Darwinian evolution, is true, 
this does not alter the genuine religious belief in God.  God is not an 
explanation, because God is not in competition with any explanatory 
theory.  Losing belief in God because of scientific advance reveals an 
inadequate conception of God.
<p>
Similarly, genuine belief in God is not hypothetical or theoretical.  To 
treat God as a hypothesis is to believe in God tentatively; new evidence 
could arise at any time to show that our hypothesis was mistaken.  We 
woulld have to check scientific and philosophical journals regularly to 
ensure that our belief in God was stil rational.
<p>
pages 25 and 26
</blockquote>

<b>God is not an inference, but a presupposition</b>
<blockquote>
For a Proof of God to be an appropriate task, it must be grammatically and 
religiously acceptable to be able to treat God, at least in part, as an 
inference from an idea of unsurpassable perfection, facts about the world, 
or the existence of the world itself.  Phillips opposes such a view by 
arguing that God is an ungrounded presupposition in the believer's 
world-view.  God is not to be inferred, but things are to be inferred from 
God.
<p>
God, for Wittgenstein, is a measure or a yardstick, not something to be 
inferred from some other measure such as philosophical reasoning.  Belief 
in God is the undergirding of a way of looking at the world, not the result 
of simply looking at the world and trying to explain it.  Religious belief 
is too fundamental and all-encompassing to be able to base it upon 
external factors.
<p>

Now, I think I disagree with just about <em>everything</em> here.  I'll 
explain why soon.  I'll let you chew on it for a little while.

<a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/">Tim Chow</a> has written a neat exposition of <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/mathstuff/forcingdum">forcing for dummies</a>.  It's a misnomer.  It's forcing for those who know what <a href="http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt2.html">Zermelo-Fraenkel</a> <a href="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/3/0,5716,117513+9,00.html">set</a> <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Math/Logic_and_Foundations/Set_Theory/">theory</a> is, and who have probably seen a forcing proof before, and who want to get a feel for Cohen's forcing proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis from the ZF axioms.  That's me.

Some <em>mathematics</em>:
<p>
In mathematical circles, there is the overall opinion that formulae, in their capacity of syntactic units, are dead things, and that formula manipulation tears the heart out of mathematics. In these circles, formulae largely live by virtue of what they stand for, of what they mean, of how they feel and appeal to our intuitionâour(?) intuition? And their meanings then tell which formulae to consider next. Poor Leibniz, poor Lagrange, poor Boole, poor Hilbert, and all others who shifted their attention
towards uninterpreted formulae manipulation: they were all wrong, werenât they?

<a href="http://www.asis.gov.au/recruitment.htm">This entry</a> is here just in case I decide I need a career change.   
<p>
However, I'm happy where I am at present, and frankly, a move to spying for Australia is not an option.  <a href="http://www.asis.gov.au/">ASIS</a> probably already know about that meeting of the <a href="http://www.iso.org.au/">International Socialists</a> I went to as an undergraduate.  That will rule me out.
<p>
My brief flirtation with organised socialism was pretty revealing.  The socialists were <em>much</em> better at following up interested students than the Christian groups on campus (probably because of having to deal with a smaller level of interest in conservative Queensland).  I think that my mother more than just a little freaked out when the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=googlet&amp;q=ian%20rintoul%20international%20socialists">notorious</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.parliament.qld.gov.au/handocs/1991.pdf/910226ha.pdf+ian+rintoul+international+socialists&amp;hl=en&amp;client=googlet">Ian</a> <a href="http://www.marxmail.org/archives/december98/sects.htm">Rintoul</a> and an associate paid me a visit.  It was the Sunday afternoon immediately after the evangelistic "What is Socialism?" meeting I attended to check out other student groups on <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">campus</a>. They spent a quick 15 minutes over coffee guaging my interest and possible commitment to the cause.
<p>
Anyway, if <a href="http://www.asis.gov.au/">they</a> didn't know of that meeting back then, they probably do now.</p>

The <a href="http://www.bridgeclimb.com/">bridge climb</a> last night was an experience.  A highly recommended one.  There's no difficulty at all, and absolutely no danger.  It was less edgy than I would have liked; probably because your focal length is foreshortened at night.  (We were at the summit at approximately 8:45).  A daytime climb would give you a greater sense of depth of field.  Perhaps I will do that in approximately thirteen years' time, if the company running it is still operating then.</p>

I got off the bus this morning and walked to my building, to see (from the outside) that I'd left my office window wide open.  There was a on metre square of air between my seventh-floor office desk and computer and the outside world.  There was a <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0103/01/national/national11.html">violent storm yesterday late afternoon and evening</a> after I had left work.  
<p>
At least I knew from last night that my computer was still working.  I waited to see the state of the rest of the desk as I took the lift up the building.
<p>
It's dried out, at least.
