Dear Science Warriors,<p>
Isn't "paraconsistent logic" as far removed from reality as the
most far-fetched of post-modernist hokum?  If so, why have you kept
silent regardng those who allow that a proposition may be both true
and false (at the same time and in the same respect)?<p>
      Is this irrational doctrine any the less to be deplored because
it issues from the mouths of influential logicians?  If not, why
haven't you censured those responsible for this irrationalist hype?
Could it be because their backers include the Association of Symbolic
Logic and the editors of _Mind_ and _Logique et Analyse_?<p>
      O warriors of science: what will you do, now that the dialethic
disease has taken root in mathematical logic?  Will you recognise that
the apostles of inconsistency are the vilest of charlatans?  Will you
indict your own kind for mathematical decadence, for having gotten in
bed (many for grants) with the henchmen of this nefast movement? Or
will you find some pretext for justifying an intellectual
licentiousness that you would have lost no time in repudiating had it
been indulged by post-modernists?
<p>
Cordially,
Spartacus

<p>"If a German philosopher emulated Dummett and published a 700-page tome about Frege without a single quotation or reference, any acclaim would be tempered by ridicule." [<a href="http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/highlights/words_things_apr99/">*</a>]</p>

<p>At last it's official.  As of July 1, 2002, I'll be an Associate Professor in <a href="http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/">Philosophy</a> at the <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>.  Coming to the decision wasn't easy -- especially in waiting for the job to come through for Christine -- but it's all fallen into place pretty well.  (Well, apart from somewhere to live, and a few other things like that.)  Wish us luck!</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://can.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/">Logic and Terror</a> by A. R. D. Mathias, is an interesting short history of the tightrope that Soviet logicians had to walk in the last century.  Stalin was a smart guy.  The qualities of intelligence, power and viciousness are a hard mix to deal with.
<blockquote>
It is generally recognised that no science can develop and ourish without a battle of
opinions, without freedom of criticism. But those generally recognised rule was ignored
and outed in the most outrageous fashion. A tight group of infallible leaders, having
insured themselves against all possible criticism began to act arbitrarily and highhandedly.
To give one example: the so called Baku course, by N.Y.Marr, unreservedly included in
the lists of manuals recommended to students. This means that the students were deceived
by having a rejected "course" presented to them as a first class text-book.
<p>
<em>If I were not convinced of the integrity of comrade Meshchaninov and the other
linguistic leaders, I would say that such conduct is tantamount to sabotage.</em>
<p>
N.Y.Marr introduced into linguistics the incorrect non-Marxist formula that language is
a superstructure, and got himself into a muddle and put linguistics into a muddle. Soviet
linguistics cannot be advanced on the basis of an incorrect formula.
I think that the sooner our linguistics is rid of N.Y.Marr's errors the sooner will it be
possible to extricate it from its present crisis.
</blockquote>
If my own vice-chancellor involved herself in my setting of my course curriculum to this extent, I'd be worried.  If it were <em>Stalin</em>, I think I'd get out of the profession and work as a manual labourer instead.

<p>Happy three months, <a href="http://consequently.org/zachary/">Zack</a>!

Tasmania was a blast.  Lots of fun, lots of philosophy, lots of good conversation.  It's a good time to be active and thinking and working.
<p>

<p>
Things have been quiet on the website front, but hectic elsewhere.  Hot water systems needing replacing (and the saga taking three days), Zack going through a sleepless phase (which seems over for the moment, at least), floorboards in the dining room popping because of wet weather and bad ventilation, and <em>work</em>, <em>work</em>, <em>work</em>.  More activity seems to be happening <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html">there</a> than here at present.  </p>

I'm in Tasmania for the 2001 Australasian Association for Philosophy <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/docs/humsoc/philosophy/seminars/announcement.html">Conference</a>, and in particular, for my <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/pluralism2001/">logical pluralism stream</a>.  It's way too much fun to be spending any time here.   Enjoy an <em>embrace</em> from <a href="http://www.oir.ucf.edu/wm/paint/auth/klee/">Paul Klee</a> in my absence.</p>
