Some advice: If you're an undergraduate attempting to take the short-cut to a good grade on an essay, by plagiarising.  For your own sake, attempt to plagiarise from someone writes no better than you do.  There is something thoroughly disconcerting about the jump from turgid, knotted, ungrammatical prose to smooth, well written text.  It's <em>dead easy</em> for us to spot.  
<p>
Of course, if you <em>can't tell</em> the difference yourself, it's rather hard for you to follow this advice.  Learning to read well goes hand-in-hand with learning to write well.  Learning how to plagiarise well should hopefully go hand-in-hand with not needing to plagiarise.

Once upon a time them was a universe. In this universe there was a planet. On this planet there was virtually no laughter. Nothing like ``humor'' was really known. People never laughed, nor jested, nor kidded, nor joked, nor anything like that. The inhabitants were extremely serious, conscientious, sincere, hard-working, studious, well wishing, and moral. But of humor they knew nothing. All except for a small minority who had some feeling for what humor was. These people occasionally laughed and joked. Their behavior was extremely alarming to everyone else and was regarded as an obviously pathological phenomenon. These few people were called ``laughers,'' and they were promptly hospitalized. What was so alarming about their behavior was not only the strange noises they made and the peculiar facial expressions they bore while ``laughing,'' but the utterly pathological things they said! They seemed to lose all sense of reality. They said things which were totally irrational, indeed sometimes logically self-contradictory. In short, they behaved exactly like anyone else who was deluded or hallucinated, hence they were put into hospitals.

Are you a philosopher?  Are you a <em>good</em> philosopher?  Are you looking for a good job, with future prospects?  Do you want to work in a healthy, growing, lively department with good students?  If so, look <a href="http://www.pers.mq.edu.au/ads/2001/May/scmp.html">here</a>.</p>

There's no doubt about it: Caring for small children really takes it out of you.  I'm tired in ways I haven't been tired for ages.  Christine is moreso.  At least I get the chance to take a break and teach classes.  Christine is on call for most of the day.  Zack is an incredibly good baby (almost invariably sleeping through from around midnight to around 5am) but the hours before midnight can be trying for all three of us. The point?  Please understand if your friends with newborns <em>change</em> after the birth of their child.  If they don't, they're not doing it right.  
<p>
Actually, I can say more: if they don't they're probably male and are not involved in childcare.  It has been interesting to hear the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s293487.htm">debate</a> over <a href="http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/dept/ssal/staff/susanmaushart/">Susan Maushart</a>'s new book <em>Wifework</em>.  The basic thesis of the book is sound: it's so very easy for a man in a heterosexual relationship to leave everything to do with running the household and looking after kids to his partner.  It's an insidious form of infantilism, and it's inherently unstable as anyone familiar with <a href="http://www.wpunj.edu/cohss/philosophy/courses/hegel/MASLAVE.HTM">Hegel's analysis of the Master/Slave dialectic</a> will recognise.
<p>
As Christine and I joke to each other: <em>everyone</em> should have a wife.  Unfortunately, it's a lot easier for men to find them than women.

<p><a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF">This</a> is loads of fun.  (At least, to a logician like me.)  It's <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF">Grammatical Framework</a>: a collection of packages in the functional programming language <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> which help you do interesting things with language.  It's beautiful because it uses some technology from <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/">logics I like</a>, and it can do really neat things, such as translation.  One simple but striking example results from when you translate a formal proof like this:
<p>
[IMAGE MISSING]
<!--- <IMG SRC="/images/proof.gif" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="126" BORDER="1" ALT="a formal proof"> -->
</p> 
into a piece of English text like this:
<blockquote>
Theorem. For all numbers x, x is even or x is odd.
<p>
Proof. We proceed by induction. For the basis, by the first axiom of
evenness, zero is even. A fortiori, zero is even or zero is odd.
For the induction step, consider a number x and assume x is even or x
is odd with x=x (h). By the hypothesis h, x is even or x is odd. There are
two possibilities. First, assume x is even ( a ). By the hypothesis a,
x is even. By the second axiom of evenness, the successor of x is
odd. A fortiori, the successor of x is even or the successor of x is
odd. Second, assume x is odd ( b ). By the hypothesis b, x is odd.
By the third axiom of evenness, the successor of x is even. A
fortiori, the successor of x is even or the successor of x is odd.
Thus the successor of x is even or the successor of x is odd in both
cases. Hence, for all numbers x, x is even or x is odd.

<p>Sometimes things are linked to other, quite different things.  Looking up <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/">Richard Heck</a>'s work <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/html/philosophy.html">on Frege</a> I found <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/sitin.pdf">his</a> <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/sitin2.pdf">involvement</a> in the Harvard Living Wage Campaign.  That reminded me to check up on how the campaign was going (you don't know about it?  It was a student-led sit in to encourage the Harvard Administration to pay every full time worker at Harvard enough to actually survive on.  Radical idea, I know.)  Anyway, <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~pslm/livingwage/index.html">this page</a> gives you the run-down on how the campaign has gone.  In summary, there are improvements, but the situation is not ideal.  That's the most we can expect in these sorts of political action, but it's obviously not the most you can ask or campaign for.  (What's an <em>ideal</em> if it's not something to aim at?)

<p>A few days ago, a postcard appeared in my pigeonhole at work: it advertised the website <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/highered/enews">e-news on higher education</a>, at which you can see what the Federal <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/">Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs</a> takes to be interesting news in higher education.  It's not particularly gripping reading, but I suppose I have to keep in touch with what those with the purse strings take to be important.

<p>
Browsing around there, I was lead to the page <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/">Which Course? Which University?</a>, which attempts to give an overview of undergraduate courses available in the higher education system, with an aim to advising potential entry level students.  What you actually <em>get</em> is another thing.  It's a hodge-podge where every institution provides its own <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/arts/9macquarie.html">marketing-speak</a> designed to cover as many bases as possible.  So, where can I study <em>philosophy</em>?  It turns out that a cursory <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/search/search.asp?qu=philosophy">search</a> leads me to a list of 130 pages which mention the word "philosophy" (including all of those which mention different institutions' <a href="http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/architecture/2uwa.html">teaching philosophy</a>).    The site is of little value for anyone wanting to know the distinctives of this or that university.  Even <a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/">the</a> <a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/">main</a> <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">websites</a> <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">of</a> <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">each</a> <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/">university</a> are little help, as they all speak the usual corporate language, pushing the same buttons, offering everything to everyone.  No university material I have ever seen says "Don't come here for subject <em>X</em>, we're not particularly good at that.  Come here for subject <em>Y</em>.  The people over at institution <em>B</em> are the place to go to learn <em>X</em>."  In these times of maximising enrolment, this will not happen any time soon, either.  It is a pity, because some honesty would not only be good for the students -- it would benefit staff too, who would get students more suited to their own special abilities and interests.  </p>

<p>A new <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/default.htm">Philosophical Gourmet Report</a> is out.  The report is notorious among philosophers for being idiosyncratic, opinionated and <em>wrong</em>, chiefly because almost no-one is happy for where their institution appears in the <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/rankings.htm">rankings</a>, but also because the rankings (determined by <a href="http://www.dla.utexas.edu/depts/philosophy/faculty/leiter/main.html">one man</a> and his <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/methods.htm">contacts</a>) influence the choices of graduate students deciding where to study.  Any ranking like this is bound to be personal, biased, and as a result, get up the nose of lots of academics.  After all, we're pretty picky about our own turf.
<p>
I'm not so interested in the rankings (and not because <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/">we</a> don't (yet?) appear in the "<a href="http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/rankings.htm#australasia">Top 5 Australasian Programs</a>").

<blockquote>
... when the chorus in <em>Oedipus at Colonus</em> gloomily declares, "Not to be born is best of all," the appropriate riposte is: How many are so lucky?
</blockquote>
Well, perhaps, perhaps not.  If the chorus is saying that for each and every one of us, it would have been better for us not to be born, then that's not an appropriate response at all.  The point is not how many people are lucky enough not to have come into existence, but rather, of the people who do exist, their existence is a <em>misfortune</em>.   It's like when you say that it's a good idea to avoid harming others.  Exactly <em>how</em> many harms have the good fortune of not existing?

It's tricky, counting denizens of the shadowy underworld of the nonexistent.</p>

<p>"I'm confused. I keep hearing that big companies are giving big money to political parties. Aren't the people responsible for these donations the same ones who say that giving the shareholder's money to charities or to fund a less profitable service to people in the bush is morally wrong because they have a duty to use it for the benefit of shareholders? I guess political donations must have a good rate of return. If they don't then the donations would be a kind of stealing from shareholders wouldn't they? So where's the path to the bottom line?"

This is too many people to (legally) fit in our tiny car (at least if we want to <em>go</em> anywhere in it) so we'll have to be creative about entertaining ourselves and getting out and about.

But now, I have to trek in to work and attempt to teach <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/ug/281">philosophy</a>, despite having a brain fogged up with thoughts of Zack: nappies, baths, finding out new things, learning to live, calming him when he's agitated, and enjoying exploring the world.  It's a lot like falling in love.  Your thoughts and life have a new focus.  No, that's wrong, it's not <em>like</em> falling in love again, it <em>is</em> falling in love again.  As always, everything is not the same.  Certainly things are different for Zack.  He has entered a foreign, exciting and dangerous world, full of delights and terrors, after leaving the comparative safety of a womb.  
<p>
So, in a way, have I.</p>
