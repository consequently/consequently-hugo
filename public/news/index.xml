      <title>Community (the twelfth of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I love the way I&amp;rsquo;ve met so many different people through working in logic, that I&amp;rsquo;ve made good friends, good colleagues, good teachers and mentors. I’ve been part of an enterprise that’s larger than any one person. I have been shaped by that community, and have had the opportunity to made some small mark on it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logic, like any other academic discipline, has a history. The activities of &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; logic — of &lt;em&gt;studying&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;researching&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; — are spread out through time. Those activities are also, equally, spread out in space. Logic is done in many different places, in many different contexts, by many different individuals, and research teams.  As I’ve already pointed out, those activities are shaped by different disciplinary connections (into philosophy, mathematics, computer science, linguistics, engineering, etc.), but they are also shaped by the emphases of different research groups and traditions. Research, these days, is dominated not so much by a small number of iconic logicians, but by research groups with distinctive research programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples: think of the difference between Amsterdam-style modal logic, on the one hand, and exact truthmaking semantics on the other, concerning approaches to intensionality and hyperintensionality, or for examples on the proof theoretical side of the street, the different traditions of Higher Order Type Theory and of Linear Logic and Ludics as frameworks for understanding proof, computation and meaning. The differences between these traditions are not simply matters of differences between individual researchers and their emphases — though of course, there are significant founding figures for each tradition I mention — the driving forces in each of these active research programmes is at the level of the &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; or beyond. Each approach brings with it a (larger or smaller) loose formation of researchers who work on problems in their fields: they get together at conferences and workshops, co-author papers, apply for research grants, supervise graduate students, all the while, maintaining and developing the tradition. Research that leaves a mark is not so much the activity of the brilliant sole researcher, it occurs at a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising this fact brings important questions to the fore: given that research at this scale is a community enterprise, how does that community function? Who is included? Who is excluded? How are people trained and shaped? What kinds of conversations are possible? What approaches are encouraged? My little corner of philosophical logic is only beginning to explicitly address some of these issues. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gillianrussell.net&#34;&gt;Gill Russell&lt;/a&gt; and worked to get a decent gender balance in our &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/new-waves-in-philosophical-logic/&#34;&gt;edited collection&lt;/a&gt;. We partly succeeded on that front. We fail, mightily, on including participants from outside Europe, America and Australia. Further, the group of authors is overwhelmingly white. We could have done better. There is scope for the community to be more representative of thew wider community around us. Lasting change will require more than just good will and effort from individuals: it will involve broader social change, so that the oppressed and excluded get their due, and all to have the opportunities currently afforded to those who have the easiest access to higher education. That social change won’t come easy. However, those of us with the institutional capital to be able to shape and support research groups nonetheless have the opportunity to leave the discipline better than we found it, with a wider spectrum of voices included, with all people treated well, and a broader family of concerns taken seriously.  We can run conferences where people are treated well; we can mentor and support our students, both women and men; we can encourage the work of those whose voices are routinely excluded, and so, build up a community that is resilient and flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I’ve been fortunate, more fortunate than I can readily discern. Not only have I been shaped by encouraging and supportive teachers and mentors throughout my own research career, but unlike many of my female colleagues, I’ve not been harassed or endangered. No-one has attempted to take advantage of me, or pass my work off as theirs. Overwhelmingly, people in my field have taken me seriously, even when I was a blundering student, attempting to find my way in the wider academic world. The reception I’ve had in the wider academic world is the kind of community I want for those coming after me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt; is the twelfth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning and Teaching (the eleventh of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-11-learning-and-teaching/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Working in philosophical logic, I love the opportunity to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; from so many people through history, and not only to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;, but to pass on a tradition, and to have the opportunity to extend the tradition, and to refine it a little, in passing it on.  It’s been a delight to learn from some &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/&#34;&gt;great figures&lt;/a&gt;, the historical figures through their writing, and my contemporaries in person, both as &lt;em&gt;face-to-face teachers&lt;/em&gt; (while a student, I learned logic from Sheila Oates-Williams, Neil Williams, Rod Girle, Ian Hinckfuss, and Graham Priest), but the learning doesn’t stop when you finish your degree. I’ve learned much from colleagues (Bob Meyer, Richard Sylvan, John Slaney, Allen Hazen, Graham Priest (again), Zach Weber, Dave Ripley, Shawn Standefer), whose work I admire, and who generously share of their time at whiteboards, in seminars, and in many many conversations. I have also learned a great deal from all of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/&#34;&gt;graduate students&lt;/a&gt;, who have sent me in directions I never expected to head. If learning logic is (in part) &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-05-recognition/&#34;&gt;gaining facility with the concepts you have&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-06-expansion/&#34;&gt;acquiring new concepts&lt;/a&gt;, then working &lt;em&gt;with others&lt;/em&gt; is a very good way to learn. The kinds of knowledge you acquire is not merely &lt;em&gt;knowing that&lt;/em&gt;, but it (at least in part) skills to be learned, and they’re learned by practice, and sometimes skilled practice is best acquired when guided by others — explicitly, when the teacher knows she is &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; — or implicitly, when we observe an expert displaying expertise, and we can use their practice to scaffold our own, and learn by imitation. I’ve learned so much from my teachers, not only in consciously building on their ideas, but in learning how to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a logician by starting in their footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to develop the tradition is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/&#34;&gt;teach&lt;/a&gt;, and a significant part of my job at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; is to teach, and a lot of my time is spent teaching philosophical logic. Putting together a course is a good way of sorting out your ideas, and in philosophical logic, where the concepts very clearly and precisely build on prior ideas, it is a real intellectual challenge to see how you can teach a course in 12 weeks that, say, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2017/PHIL30043&#34;&gt;introduces Gödel’s incompleteness theorems&lt;/a&gt; and everything you need to understand them. This is a challenge, and designing the curriculum in such a way to carry undergraduate students from the basics of predicate logic, through soundness and completeness, into Peano arithmetic, recursive functions, diagonalisation, and into Gödel’s proofs — and to do it in some way that there is hope that the students will survive the journey with their curiosity and interest intact! — forces you to come to grips with the concepts in a way that a cursory understanding won’t suffice. I can truly say that I’ve come to understand things much more deeply when I’ve had the opportunity to &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m enjoying &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ptp/&#34;&gt;writing my new book&lt;/a&gt;. Officially, it is a research monograph and not a textbook, but one of the ways I’ve been describing it (to myself, and to others, who ask me what I’m writing on) is that it’s trying to explain to people attracted to normative pragmatic theories of meaning what they can do with recent work in logic (in proof theory, in particular), and to explain to logicians what philosophy they should have to understand why proof theory works so well. Yes, the core of it is a particular &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; for a way of understanding the distinctive nature of logic, but that argument is buttressed by a lot of &lt;em&gt;showing&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt;. You’ve got to &lt;em&gt;learn some logic&lt;/em&gt; to understand why it is the kind of thing it is, and to get a real sense of what it can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; (and what it can’t). To do that, is to &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt;, as well as to &lt;em&gt;argue&lt;/em&gt;, and that is just how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning and Teaching&lt;/em&gt; is the eleventh of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Possibility (the tenth of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-10-possibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 14:38:20 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-10-possibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-09-necessity/&#34;&gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt; I explored the connection between &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt;. Here, I want to spend a little time exploring the other side of the logical street, the connection between &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt;. As I have already explained, one core insight from 20th Century work in logic is the fundamental duality between proof theory and model theory. You can define logical notions like validity by way of proofs (a &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; argument is certified by the existence of some proof) or by way of models (an argument is shown to be &lt;em&gt;invalid&lt;/em&gt; by the existence of some model which serves as a &lt;em&gt;counterexample&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring proofs gives you can account of the different ways that concepts are tied together. (It gives you an account of what is involved in different kinds of necessary connections. The more different proofs you have, the more connections are possible.) Approaching the validity/invalidity boundary on the other side, by way of models, gives you a very different picture of this boundary. Defining more &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; means having more &lt;em&gt;counterexamples&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model building is one very fruitful way of articulating what is &amp;mdash; and more importantly, what &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; a part of a theory. Suppose you are interested in some strange new theory. (Put yourself back into the 19th Century, and consider a strange newfangled theory of geometry, where you accept the first four of Euclid&amp;rsquo;s axioms, but you &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; the parallel postulate.) You&amp;rsquo;ve got your collection of basic principles, but you&amp;rsquo;re not sure what follows from them. If you can manage to build a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; for your theory, then this can begin to address the question of what the theory involves. In particular, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; can give you a decisive answer to some questions about what the theory &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; involve. If your model \(\mathfrak M\) gives you a way to interpret all of the basic principles of the theory as being true, and if some other claim \(A\) turns out to be &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; in \(\mathfrak M\), then you can see how \(A\) &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; follow from those basic principles. \(\mathfrak M\) gives you a picture of how the theory could be true, and in this case, it shows how \(A\) comes apart from the axioms of the theory. (So, if you think that  \(A\) &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be true, according to the theory you&amp;rsquo;re exploring, you need to supplement your axioms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a model on hand &amp;mdash; in and of itself &amp;mdash; gives you little information about what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; follow, because theories can have more than one model, in which different things hold. If something is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true in a model for your theory, that tells you that it is not a consequence of the first principles theory; but when something &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true in a model for your theory, that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily enough to show you that it is a consequence of the first principles of the theory. After all, it might hold in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; models, and not others. To show that something does follow (given the soundness and completeness theorems) we need to show that it holds in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; model of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, models, in and of themselves don&amp;rsquo;t do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, but they are an excellent way to open up new areas of logical space. The development of models of non-Euclidean geometries helped us expand our understanding of what is involved in talk of points and lines. The development of models of different modal logics or non-classical logics helps us come to grips with different options for how basic propositional notions such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, conditionality, possibility and necessity might fit together. Models are useful tools for sketching out options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, models for theories give us powerful tools for exploring logical notions, and they provide an especially powerful way for expanding our bounds of understanding what is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. Constructing a model of a theory is one way to show how that theory &lt;em&gt;could be true&lt;/em&gt;.  I love the way which the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of logical space is a wide plenitude, that the different antecedents for a &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; lead us in so many different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibility&lt;/em&gt; is the tenth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Necessity (the ninth of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-09-necessity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 23:55:19 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-09-necessity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The next two thoughts are motivated by the two complementary aspects of contemporary research in logic, &lt;em&gt;proof theory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;model theory&lt;/em&gt;. As I try to emphasise to my students, there are two broad ways you can define logical concepts like &lt;em&gt;validity&lt;/em&gt;. Following the way of &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;, an argument is valid if there is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; proof leading from the premises to the conclusion. Following the way of &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt;, an argument is valid if there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; model in which the premises are true and the conclusion is not. In proof theory, validity is vouchsafed by the existence of something: a &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;, which certifies the claim to validity. Invalidity is the absence of such a certificate. In model theory, &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;validity is vouchsafed by the existence of something: a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; a &lt;em&gt;counterexample&lt;/em&gt; to the claim of validity. Validity is the absence of any such counterexample. It was a great intellectual advance to understand that these are two very different ways to define logical concepts, such as validity, and it was a further advance to be able to rigorously prove that (on certain understandings of logic, such as classical first order predicate logic), these two different kinds of definitions can coincide to determine the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; concept. A &lt;em&gt;soundness&lt;/em&gt; theorem (relating an account of proofs and a account of models) shows that these two notions don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;clash&lt;/em&gt;: you never get both a proof showing that some argument is valid, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a model showing that it is invalid. A &lt;em&gt;completeness&lt;/em&gt; theorem (also relating an account of proofs and a account of models) shows that these two notions cover the whole field &amp;mdash; for each argument, we &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; have a proof (showing it is valid) or a counterexample (showing that it isn&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a sound and complete account of proofs and models for a particular understanding of validity gives you a very powerful toolkit: you can approach a question concerning validity in two distinct ways, by the way of proofs (attempting to build a bridge from the premises to the conclusions, or showing that there isn&amp;rsquo;t any) or by the way of models (attempting to show that there is a chasm between the premises and the conclusions by showing that there is some way to make the premises true and the conclusions untrue, or again, showing that there isn&amp;rsquo;t any). These two ways of accounting for validity have very different affordances, they are good for different things, both mathematically or technically, and philosophically or conceptually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly interested in the kinds of conceptual gains that are possible when applying notions of proof and notions of model, and the modes of thinking that are involved when using these different tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One connection that I am beginning to learn is the intimate connection between proof and &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt;, between logical consequence and the hardness and fixity of the logical &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;. It is one thing to think that an argument is valid, in the sense that it happens to fail to have a counterexample. It is another to have an account of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is valid. What a proof gives you is some kind of account of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you can get from the premises to the conclusion. This kind of thing is quite powerful, especially given the generality of logical concepts. The power of concepts like conjunction, negation, the quantifiers, etc., (I think) is that our norms and rules for using them apply under the scope of suppositions (whether those suppositions are subjunctive alternatives &amp;mdash; suppose that \(A\) had been the case &amp;mdash; or indicative alternatives  &amp;mdash; suppose that, after all \(A\) is actually true), if we suppose that \(A\land B\) is true, it&amp;rsquo;s still totally appropriate (under the scope of that supposition) to deduce \(A\) and to deduce \(B\), the usual rules for conjunction still apply.  A &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; (on this view) from premises to a conclusion is the kind of chain of reasoning which will work under any different supposition. It shows us how the conclusion is already present, implicit in the premises. To have granted the premises is to be committed (at least implicitly) to the conclusion, and the proof renders that consequential commitment &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, when confronted with a proof of an unacceptable conclusion from premises you have accepted, one appropriate response would be to reject one or another of the premises, and to resist the conclusion. That is always an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings logic up close to issues in &lt;em&gt;metaphysics&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;epistemology&lt;/em&gt; and in &lt;em&gt;philosophy of language&lt;/em&gt;. In metaphysics, we ask questions about the ultimate nature of reality, and the bounds of what is possible, or what is necessary. Of how reality is and how it must be. The kind of necessary connection between premises and conclusion of a valid argument must bring us up to the boundary of metaphysical necessity. If something is metaphysically &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, then it must count as at least logically possible. If there is a way the world is that makes \(A\) true, then \(A\) cannot be logically inconsistent. If we could prove a triviality from \(A\), then this argument would apply were the world to be the way that possibility describes. Proofs in logic tell us &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about what is necessary.  (Of course, this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that anything that is necessary is vouchsafed by a proof. That would be to say much more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, proofs can also play an &lt;em&gt;epistemic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dialogical&lt;/em&gt; role. Provided that you and I agree on the norms governing our logical vocabulary, then if we possess a proof from \(A\) to \(B\), we agree that it&amp;rsquo;s out of bounds to accept \(A\) and reject \(B\). The proof can show us this much, to help map out the conceptual topography, see the space of possible options for us, even if we disagree on which options to take (perhaps you accept \(A\) and \(B\), and I reject both). A proof will do this work, even if we disagree on matters of necessity. Perhaps I take \(A\) to not only be false but to be &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;, and you take \(B\) to be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;. (Such disputes are common in philosophy.) Regardless of the fact that one or other of us may be beyond the bounds of possibility, dispute here can still be rational. If, in the course of our reasoning, I begin to take your position as a live option (this is surely possible), I now have two positions before me: to accept \(A\) and \(B\), and to take them as &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, or to reject \(A\) and \(B\) and to take them as &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;.  When I do this, I can take something to be an &lt;em&gt;epistemic possibility&lt;/em&gt; (a live option) which I think may also be metaphysically &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;. When we use the tools of &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;, we have guides to help see what positions are open to us, even if this does not tell us the whole story of which position may be best to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way in which the &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt; of the logical &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; brings us right up to concerns of metaphysics and epistemology, of the nature of reality and what options we have as we attempt to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Necessity&lt;/em&gt; is the ninth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attention (the eighth of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-08-attention/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:01:56 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-08-attention/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not totally happy with the word for the next item on the list of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;. The word on the list is &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt;, and it gets at something that I have learned, and which seems to me to be an important distinctive about working in &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; logic, but I&amp;rsquo;m not altogether sure that &amp;ldquo;attention&amp;rdquo; is the best word for it. Maybe after I&amp;rsquo;ve explained what I mean, you could suggest a better short label for the phenomenon I&amp;rsquo;m gesturing towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the core idea: when you spend time working with core logical notions such as &lt;em&gt;consequence&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;consistency&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;,  you notice that you are attending to judgements and thoughts and claims in more than one way. You learn to distinguish between taking a claim to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, and considering it as &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. You can agree that even though \(p\) isn&amp;rsquo;t true, it is &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; with \(q\). You can agree that it&amp;rsquo;s not true that \(p\) while still seriously entertain what it would be like &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; \(p\) to be true. Working with \(p\) as an hypothesis is not the same thing as taking it to be true. But even though working under the supposition that \(p\) is not the same thing as taking \(p\) to be true, it is related intimately to it. You don&amp;rsquo;t just consider at \(p\) from the &amp;ldquo;outside.&amp;rdquo; (Say, look at those crazy people who believe \(p\)! Aren&amp;rsquo;t they weird?) Instead, you &amp;ldquo;try it on for size&amp;rdquo; in the sense that you let your inferential norms and processes act on \(p\) as if it were one among the other things you are working with. You temporarily adopt \(p\) into your view of the world, or you change perspective and attempt to see what things look like from the other side of the street, backgrounding your prior commitment to \(\neg p\) (if you actually believe \(p\) is false), and trying a different set of commitments on for size. This moves you in the direction of a kind of intellectual sympathy. You can gain some insight concerning some of what it would be like to actually see things from \(p\)&amp;rsquo;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one way in which familiarity with core concepts of logic facilitates distinct skills for attending to judgement, and thereby, of paying attention to how we attend to the world around us, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, I&amp;rsquo;m not totally happy with &amp;ldquo;attention&amp;rdquo; as the word for this &amp;mdash; the skill attained is not the acquisition of &lt;em&gt;sustained, focussed attention&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, your attention is often scattered, unfocussed, and you&amp;rsquo;re easily distracted, and if my history of 25 years working in philosophical logic is any testament, it&amp;rsquo;s not that becoming a logician is in and of itself a great help with dealing with distraction. (There are other practices which foster sustained, focussed attention and awareness, like meditation, prayer, reading, physical activity, etc.). No, instead, what is involved is a kind of suppleness of attention, the ability to shift between different positions, to creatively see things from different sides, and to take in different views. It&amp;rsquo;s those skills of attention that can be fostered when you spend time with the core concepts of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here is another thing that I love in working in philosophical logic&amp;mdash;how growing into mastery of core logical concepts has these kinds of consequences for my own thinking, my own &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt;, and as a result my own &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attention&lt;/em&gt; is the eighth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pragmatics (the seventh of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-07-pragmatics/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 12:53:42 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-07-pragmatics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Some of my phrasing in the last &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-05-recognition/&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-06-expansion/&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; about what I love about philosophical logic have emphasised &lt;em&gt;capacities&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;abilities&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve described the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-05-recognition/&#34;&gt;pleasure of the “&lt;em&gt;aha&lt;/em&gt;!” moment&lt;/a&gt; in terms of the kinds of mastery you acquire in handling the concepts you have, and I described &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-06-expansion/&#34;&gt;the joys of conceptual expansion&lt;/a&gt; in terms of abilities gained. This is to take a &lt;em&gt;pragmatic&lt;/em&gt; perspective on logic, to consider the connection to practices and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of things “pragmatically” can be understood in a very crude way, fixing in advance what how you want to measure costs and benefits, and then doing some naïve cost/benefit calculation and then choosing option that somehow maximises benefits and minimises the costs (if that is even possible). This is not what I mean when I consider the connection between logic and pragmatics. I don’t think that the best way to select some logical system or logical theory is on the basis of that kind of cost/benefit analysis. Rather, it’s that there are connections between features of logical systems and the practices of &lt;em&gt;asserting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;denying&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;inferring&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;questioning&lt;/em&gt;, etc. What kind of connections are there? It’s not that the laws of logic are descriptively correct as a theory about how assertion and denial and inference actually work in practice. Rather, they can be understood as norms governing how those acts can be evaluated. (In particular, I think that if the argument from the premise \(A\) to the conclusion \(B\) is &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt;, then taking a position in which \(A\) is asserted and \(B\) is denied is &lt;em&gt;out of bounds&lt;/em&gt;. If you’ve asserted \(A\) and \(B\) follows from \(A\) then in some sense, \(B\) is &lt;em&gt;undeniable&lt;/em&gt;, in that any positions where you rule \(A\) in and \(B\) out are out of bounds. For more on this, take a look at my “&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;”, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?cites=2800898225913341308&amp;amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;critical literature it’s spawned&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ptp&#34;&gt;manuscript I’m working on&lt;/a&gt; right now.) There’s much more to say about this, but I think that it’s a clarifying perspective on the connection between core concepts in logic and the different kinds of acts we can actually engage in, like asserting, or believing, like denying or rejecting. It is a &lt;em&gt;normative pragmatic&lt;/em&gt; position concerning logic, that the concepts provide norms or standards by which acts can be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might worry that thinking of logic in terms of rules for a contingent human practice makes those rules themselves contingent too. Now, there’s nothing wrong with laws and rules being contingent. However, it’s a radical view of &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; that takes the rules of logic to be contingent on human practices. If it’s a law of logic that either \(p\) or not \(p\) for all propositions \(p\), then it would seem to follow that either all non-avian dinosaurs were extinct by 65 million years ago, or not all non-avian dinosaurs were extinct by 65 million years ago, and that this &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; would have been the case even if there weren’t any people (or sentient creatures) around to reason about it. Contingently existing human reasoners like us can reason about all sorts of things, including what went on before contingently existing human reasoners existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an analogy I find compelling and clarifying when it comes to understanding how we can have a contingent practice with non-contingent rules. It’s the example of arithmetic and our counting practices. It’s contingently useful to creatures like us to engage in counting practices, introducing vocabulary for things we call “numbers”, which codify various practices of enumerating and pairing things up. Given that we want to engage in such a contingent practice (we have reason to keep track of the number of sheep we have in our flock, to make sure trades are fair, etc., but there was a time before any humans were doing these things), we have (again, contingent) reasons to use counting practices like those we actually have. At the very least, our counting practices give us ways to attend to patterns among practices of pairing things up. (It’s easy enough to figure out that if you have five sheep and I promised to give you three bags of grain for each of your sheep that I’ll owe you 15 bags of grain, than to laboriously pair up three bags with each sheep.) But the (contingently existing) practice of using number vocabulary in this way gets its power by having results that apply &lt;em&gt;invariantly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not necessary that we have the concepts of &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;multiplication&lt;/em&gt;, but it is necessary that if we do have concepts like these, governed in this way, then no matter what they’re counting, 3 times 5 is 15, and it is, necessarily. (Why do we want such &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt;? I’d say that this is tied up with interaction between  counting and planning: it is also true if I’ve promised three bags of grain for every sheep, then if I want 2 sheep, I owe you 6 bags; 3 sheep, then 9, etc. It’s not that the rules of counting apply differently in different hypothetical scenarios. They are applied the same way in all hypothetical scenarios.) A practice can be contingently useful while having norms that apply non-contingently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same holds, I think, for so-called logical laws, and the account &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;I prefer&lt;/a&gt; puts this down to norms governing assertion and denial. The laws of logic can be understood as arising out of fundamental norms governing the practices of assertion and denial, and their interrelationship. The &lt;em&gt;generality&lt;/em&gt; of certain laws of logic can be explained in terms of norms applying to assertion and denial &lt;em&gt;as such&lt;/em&gt;, independently of any specific subject matter of those assertions and denials. The behaviour of the regular propositional connectives can be explained as ways to make explicit what is already implicit in the practice of assertion and denial. The behaviour of modal operators can be understood in terms of making explicit &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;norms governing different kinds of supposition&lt;/a&gt;, while those for quantifiers make explicit relations of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/generality-and-existence-1/&#34;&gt;substitution and generality&lt;/a&gt;, once the practice of assertion and denial is rich enough to involve singular terms. The story, I think, is rich in connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how philosophical logic is—when rightly understood—tied up with &lt;em&gt;practices&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;activities&lt;/em&gt;. Through these connections, we see that understanding the grounds of our conceptual capacities brings logicians into the realm of practical action, in a way rather different to the picture that logicians are calculators solving predefined problems. Instead, logic is a normative discipline which describes some of the norms governing  practices of assertion, denial, description, theorising, conjecture, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t often find human concerns, our own contingent and local interests, preferences and desires — let alone the social and political concerns of life in a community — playing an explicit role inside a philosophical logician’s proof. These would be as alien there as they would inside a mathematical demonstration. However, this does not mean that these considerations are divorced from philosophical logic. After all, our interest in matters of logic have grown up with our interest in the communicative practices of asserting, denying, arguing and reasoning, and those are nothing if not social practices. Our own contingent and local circumstances and interests help explain why concepts like those from logic are worth using. It is a loss to the discipline if we don’t heed that connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connection with &lt;em&gt;pragmatics&lt;/em&gt; is the seventh of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conceptual Expansion (the sixth of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-06-expansion/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 09:26:50 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-06-expansion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There are different delights to be found in working with concepts. It is not all a matter of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-05-recognition/&#34;&gt;gaining greater mastery&lt;/a&gt; of the concepts you have already acquired. There is also a special delight to be found in acquiring &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; concepts. I love that feeling of progress when you make a conceptual advance. A common way to do this is to &lt;em&gt;disambiguate&lt;/em&gt;, to clarify matters by noticing that what you took to be one thing is really &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;. This is the clarity gained in uncovering a hidden confusion, the moment when ideas are sharpened and distinguished, when you form a new vocabulary and, as a result, you are able to say things you couldn’t express before. This one way to reap the rewards of &lt;em&gt;conceptual expansion&lt;/em&gt;. Our repertoire of concepts is larger than it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of this phenomenon. (It’s not an uncontroversial example, but it’s one that I find quite compelling.) Consider what it means to &lt;em&gt;suppose&lt;/em&gt; something. This is something we do regularly when we’re reasoning, when we’re planning, considering options, or discussing something with people who have different views. Often we “try a claim on for size”, suppose it’s the case, and reason from there. (This kind of dialectical move is something we not only &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, it’s also at the heart of different accounts of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/writing/ptp&#34;&gt;structure of proof&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an insight — a conceptual advance — to notice that the act of supposition can take different forms, that not all supposition is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/kennedy-shot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;NYT Times Kennedy Cover&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Oswald shot Kennedy. But what if he hadn&#39;t? Or what if he &lt;b&gt;didn&#39;t&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I suppose that it’s not the case that Oswald shot Kennedy, I can do this in two different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can &lt;em&gt;counterfactually&lt;/em&gt; suppose (I can suppose that Oswald &lt;em&gt;hadn’t&lt;/em&gt; shot Kennedy) and here I still grant that Oswald &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; shoot Kennedy (or at least, I leave it &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; that he did) and I could explore what would have followed in the (not-necessarily actual) circumstances where he &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt;. We do this sort of thing when we plan for the future or regret the past. We consider alternate possibilities, with an eye to understand what we can do, and what options are available to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not the only form of supposition: we &lt;em&gt;indicatively&lt;/em&gt; suppose when we ask ourselves whether we might be wrong, or when we consider what things are like from a point of view other than ours. When we suppose that Oswald &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; shoot Kennedy, we take on a different view of how things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;. I consider the option that it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen as I have taken it to happen, but that it actually happened in some other way. This is the kind of supposition involved when we&amp;rsquo;re considering opposing views and weighing different theories of how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you realise that we can be doing different things in different forms of supposition means that you have the space to allow these kinds of supposition to operate in different ways, and to explore their distinct features. (This is the direction I pursue things in my paper on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;cut-free hypersequent calculus for two-dimensional modal logic&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generation of &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; concepts is a different kind of conceptual mastery than the working out of consequences I discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org&#34;&gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt;. Here, instead of gaining mastery of an already established practice, we institute a new practice, and gain the ability to say new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conceptual Expansion&lt;/em&gt; is the sixth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Moment of Recognition (the fifth of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-05-recognition/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2017 14:29:39 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-05-recognition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is a more personal reflection on what I love in working in philosophical logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;aha&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;rdquo; moment of &lt;em&gt;recognition&lt;/em&gt;. This is the relief of  a proof completed, or a counterexample found. It is the delight of gaining clarity into something that you had only dimly understood, or the dawning realisation that an assumption you had made is in fact false and a whole new vista of possibilities opens up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular kind of &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo; that I mean is the kind where you&amp;rsquo;re working out of the consequences of something you already know. This can be understood as a kind of &lt;em&gt;mastery&lt;/em&gt; that is gained when you become familiar with the conceptual tools you&amp;rsquo;re using. It is the acquisition of greater skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo; that students in my second year logic class experienced when they figured out for themselves that not all symmetric and transitive relations must be reflexive.  In one sense, they already &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; the definitions of these concepts (at least, most of them did) and this fact was implicit in what they already knew, but now they had figured this out for themselves &amp;mdash; they &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; it for themselves. They understood something new about how these concepts fit together, how they relate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of scope for this when working in philosophical logic. We&amp;rsquo;re pushing concepts to their limits, finding the boundaries of conceptual space. We map out its  topography. Sometimes you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that things hang together in some way (say, your examples of symmetric and transitive relations all happened to be reflexive, too) and then you suddenly &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; that they&amp;rsquo;re not. That moment of recognition is the dawning of new light, the opening up of new territory, the acquisition of new conceptual capacities, and moments like these are to something to be treasured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moment of Recognition&lt;/em&gt; is the fifth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interdisciplinarity (the fourth of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-04-interdisciplinarity/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 14:27:05 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-04-interdisciplinarity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-03-multiple-realisability/&#34;&gt;multiple realisations&lt;/a&gt; of a concept in logic often come from different disciplines. One thing I’ve grown to love in philosophical logic is the way different ideas, disciplines and traditions are connected in the space of the wider generality of formal logic. In my own work over the years in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/isl&#34;&gt;substructural logic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism/&#34;&gt;logical pluralism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ptp&#34;&gt;proof theory&lt;/a&gt; (among other things), traditions in computer science, linguistics, mathematics and philosophy have all played distinct roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each discipline has its own examples, its own traditions, its own heroes, its own villains—and its own concerns. If you are aware of the distinctive features of different traditions, this allows for the strengths of those disciplines to shine, for the insights and examples of one discipline to be brought to bear on the questions and problems of others.  If you’re a philosopher, you should, by nature, be interested in more than your own traditions—or at least you should if you understand philosophy in the way Wilfrid Sellars did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term. — Wilfrid Sellars, “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the meeting ground of &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt;, the linguist can speak to the mathematician, the computer programmer to the philosopher. All too often, we don’t step outside our own disciplinary bubbles, but in logic, staying inside your own hermetically sealed discipline actually takes effort on your own part. In the late 20th Century into the early 21st, the best work in logic is being done by linguists, computer scientists, mathematicians and philosophers. No one academic discipline is in the ascendancy in logic. You’re missing out if you don’t attend to the richer tapestry of that work, and in particular, you have much to gain by learning from the best work in traditions other than your own. Since logic is such a well-worn meeting place between these disciplines, those who have some training in logic have a head start when it comes to translating from one tradition to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes interdisciplinary is understood as a relatively recent trend, and in many cases it is. Regardless, the concerns of logic naturally lend themselves to application in any different fields where we are concerned with judgement, with truth, with the way our claims hold together and bear on each other—and that is a broad tapestry. Logic has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been connected to philosophy and to mathematics, and with the rise of newer disciplines such as linguistics and computer science, the concerns of logic are deeply embedded in many domains of inquiry. Being a logician gives you a passport into these fields, and it is a pleasure to be able to venture widely, and to enjoy different scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interdisicplinarity&lt;/em&gt; is the fourth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple Realisability (the third of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-03-multiple-realisability/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 15:34:51 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-03-multiple-realisability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Closely connected to the notion of &lt;em&gt;abstraction&lt;/em&gt;, I love the way that logical concepts are &lt;em&gt;multiply realisable&lt;/em&gt;. An abstract structure can be instantiated in different ways, and often in ways completely unforeseen when the original abstraction was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twin moves of abstraction (moving from the particular to the general) and concretisation (going back from the general to the particular—perhaps to a new and &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; particular) in different domains brings different insights, different models, and new connections. These new connections often bring fresh insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the simple notion of a &lt;em&gt;Boolean algebra&lt;/em&gt; can be instantiated as a power set algebra (think of the subsets of a set and the operations of union, intersection and complementation). But this simple idea of a power set Boolean algebra can then be understood in different domains of application: you can think of the underlying set as a domain of &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt; and the subsets are extensions of different predicates. Or you can think of them as a set of possible worlds, and the subsets are propositions. And so on. Shifting from one representation to another is often conceptually fruitful when thinking about these different domains, or thinking about the ways that the formal techniques are applied. And you can answer questions about anything that counts as a Boolean algebra in one go. Here’s how the Hungarian recursion theorist Rózsa Péter put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing down of a formula is an expression of our joy that we can answer all these questions by means of one argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Rózsa Péter &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Infinity-Mathematical-Explorations-Excursions/dp/0486232654/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Playing with Infinity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more than that, once you’ve studied Boolean algebras for a while you learn that not all Boolean algebras are (isomorphic to) power set algebras. Given a domain of objects, you can get  a Boolean algebra out of less than the collection of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the subsets of the underlying set of objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: take an infinite set &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;, and think of the finite subsets of &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; — those with finitely many members — together with the co-finite subsets of &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; — those which contain all of the elements of &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; for finitely many members. (In the case of the natural numbers, the sets {0,1,2} and all of the numbers &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; {1,2,3} would be fine, but the set of even numbers doesn’t count, because it contains infinitely many members and excludes infinitely many members too.) Then these sets, the finite and co-finite subsets of &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; form a Boolean algebra. (The union, intersection or complement of finite and co-finite sets is itself finite or co-finite.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you see this, you see that there’s nothing in the idea of a Boolean algebra that means that the structure of truth values, or extensions of predicates, or propositions, &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; look like a power set Boolean algebra. Maybe it does, but maybe it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move from the particular to the general and back not only allows us to transfer insights from one domain to another, it also means that we can gain insight into unconsidered possibilities, and different ways our concepts can be realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple realisability&lt;/em&gt; is the third of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abstraction (the second of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-02-abstraction/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the previous entry, philosophical logic uses the tools and techniques from formal logic, and formal logic is nothing if it is not &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt;. It gets its power &amp;mdash; as well as its weaknesses, to be sure &amp;mdash; by abstracting away from specifics and moving to generalities. We explain the virtues of a particular argument (in part) by looking at its form, the structure which is in common to other arguments of the same shape. This goes back, at least, to Aristotle, who taught us that it isn’t a coincidence that both syllogisms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All footballers are bipeds. All bipeds have feet. Therefore all footballers have feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All wombats are cute. All cute things are popular. Therefore all wombats are popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have similar virtues. At the very least, they’re both &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt;. They both have the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;s are &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;s. All &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;s are &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;s. Therefore all &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;s are &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and any syllogisms with that form are valid. Attending to the shape of the reasoning, and “tuning out” concern about whether the premises are &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; (are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; wombats cute? Are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; footballers bipeds? — most likely not) and focussing on the form, we see how the premises and conclusions are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; is to learn how to attend to one thing and to ignore others, to look for a new level of generality. I love to take the opportunity to stand back, to look at a problem again from a different angle, to reframe it in a different way, to attend to it again, perhaps to see something new, to notice the parallels between one thing and another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the role of &lt;em&gt;abstraction&lt;/em&gt; involved in formal logic brings to the fore the aspect of logic that is a &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; task. Logic is a kind of conceptual engineering. It is always a choice to attend to focus on some features of a problem and to ignore others. Being formal and abstract, logic allows us to stand back and look for structure, to look for patterns — and the result is the delight in recognising a unifying pattern that helps us see something that we didn’t see before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstraction&lt;/em&gt; is the second of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Dialectic (the first of twelve things I love about philosophical logic)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-01-the-dialectic/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 13:36:03 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-01-the-dialectic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed when making my way from mathematics (my undergraduate degree was a B.Sc. in Mathematics at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smp.uq.edu.au/mathematics&#34;&gt;University of Queensland&lt;/a&gt;) to philosophy was the different approach when doing research in the two disciplines. To put it very coarsely, in mathematics, you prove theorems. In philosophy, you argue about things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standards for success are very different in philosophy and in mathematics.  Witness &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03486&#34;&gt;Norbert Blum&amp;rsquo;s recent retraction&lt;/a&gt; of his paper which purported to prove that &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ne; &lt;em&gt;NP&lt;/em&gt;. While philosophers change their minds about things, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall anyone going so far as to retract a paper that argued for a position they now reject. That&amp;rsquo;s just not how philosophers work, and nor should they.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the joys about working in philosophical logic &amp;mdash; especially for someone with a relatively short attention span, like me &amp;mdash; is that I get to play on both sides of this street. I spend some time as a technical mathematical logician, playing the theorem-proving game, with all of the satisfaction of knowing that I&amp;rsquo;ve really &lt;em&gt;proved&lt;/em&gt; something solid in its own way: a mathematical &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, there&amp;rsquo;s more to life than theorems, and there&amp;rsquo;s more to &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; than the making of proofs. I love that my discipline &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; logic &amp;mdash; gives equal time to the discursive, interpretive, philosophical side of the enterprise, that I can spend time writing papers attempting to give an account of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; something works, to argue with others, developing views about the &lt;em&gt;grounds&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;significance&lt;/em&gt; of different concepts or techniques, that there are no barriers to taking the synoptic view, where conjectures can be explored and where perspectives can clash and collide, without expecting that any option be closed off to inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy in working philosophical logic is more, though, than having two sides to the coin, the &lt;em&gt;formal&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;discursive&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;interpretive&lt;/em&gt;. The delight I find in the discipline is in the &lt;em&gt;dialectic&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;interplay&lt;/em&gt; between these two aspects of the craft. This delight comes when some technical result can shed light on a philosophical conundrum, or when a different interpretive perspective on problem uncovers the way to a new approach to prove a theorem. A recent example dear to my heart on the interplay between the discursive and the formal is how Mark Lance and Heath White&amp;rsquo;s work on the two forms of supposition in their &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philosophersimprint.org/007004/&#34;&gt;Stereoscopic Vision&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; motivated and inspired my work on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;cut-free hypersequent calculus for two-dimensional modal logic&lt;/a&gt;, which, in turn, has philosophical significance of its own on how we might acquire modal concepts and coordinate on their use, even when we disagree on what might be necessary or &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself in a field where the best work involves formal results addressing issues that have philosophical significance, where discursive and the technical aspects play important, interlocking roles. If you formally model a theory, you nail your colours to the mast. You have to be specific and precise about what is being proposed. This (when done well) keeps you honest. It&amp;rsquo;s harder to hide or to fudge when you&amp;rsquo;re specific and precise about your theory&amp;rsquo;s commitments. On the other hand, the philosophical imperative &amp;mdash; to understand, to probe the foundations, and to take the synoptic view &amp;mdash; means that you don&amp;rsquo;t treat the formal theory as something to be explored for its own sake. Instead, you are always able to take the critical perspective, to ask whether &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the best model for the phenomenon in question, and to push beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the &lt;em&gt;dialectic&lt;/em&gt; between the formal and the discursive; the &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt; between the technical and the critical, that makes philosophical logic such a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dialectic&lt;/em&gt; is the first of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/&#34;&gt;twelve things that I love about philosophical logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/twelve-things-i-love/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Over this last weekend, I spent some time tidying out one of the electronic &amp;ldquo;junk drawers&amp;rdquo; of my writing life, a folder full of thousands upon thousands of little scraps of text, ranging from minutes of meetings, recipes I&amp;rsquo;ve saved, little ideas I came across which I wanted to save, lists of places to visit when travelling, and many other kinds of digital flotsam and jetsam I&amp;rsquo;ve collected over around 20 years of being online, reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of junk in that big pile of text that I deleted on sight (though there were a few recipes I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to trying out in the next little while) but one thing really surprised me. It was a short list, entitled &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;12 things I love about philosophical logic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. That scrap of writing was about 200 words&amp;mdash;the &amp;ldquo;12 things&amp;rdquo; are each elaborated with only a sentence or two. I wrote it about five years ago, and I&amp;rsquo;d totally forgotten about it until coming across it this weekend. Rereading it, the ideas resonated. (My views haven&amp;rsquo;t shifted &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much over five years.) What resonated wasn&amp;rsquo;t just that I agreed with my earlier self&amp;mdash;but that I found the thoughts helpful, and they struck me as the kind of thing that you don&amp;rsquo;t often hear. Maybe other logicians have thought or said or written things like this, but if they have, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard them. It seems to me that we don&amp;rsquo;t often reflect on the pleasures of our discipline, and we don&amp;rsquo;t often commit to text much about what it is like to work in our field, or to highlight what it means to us. Reading these words from five years ago clarified some things for me, so it seems to me that it&amp;rsquo;s at least &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that they might be of some use to others, too. Maybe seeing how things appear from here can help you get some more insight into how things are for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, whether you work in philosophical logic, you work in some other field, or you&amp;rsquo;re a curious outsider who wants to get some sense of what it is that we philosophical logicians do with our time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Just a small part of my junk drawer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ll do: I&amp;rsquo;m going to spend some time expanding my &amp;ldquo;12 things&amp;rdquo; notes, and I&amp;rsquo;ll post them at roughly one per day, over the next couple of weeks. Come back &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; for the first of the 12 things I love about working in philosophical logic. By the end, the list below will contain links to each entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, before I forget, I should add a qualification. This list is idiosyncratic and particular in a number of different ways. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect that what I love is what others who work in philosophical logic love, and neither do I mean to imply that these joys are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to be found when you work in philosophical logic.  In giving this list, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to universalise to other people&amp;rsquo;s experience, or to claim any particular distinction for my discipline in comparison to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear back from you, especially if these thoughts spark any reflections of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conditionals in Closed Set Logic</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/closed-set-logic/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2017 14:23:43 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/closed-set-logic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of days on Twitter, I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sigfpe/status/887754687318966272&#34;&gt;involved in a thread&lt;/a&gt;, kicked off by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sigfpe&#34;&gt;Dan Piponi&lt;/a&gt;, discussing closed set logic&amp;mdash;the natural dual of intuitionistic logic in which the law of the excluded middle holds but the law of non-contradiction fails, and which has models in the closed sets of any topological space, as opposed to the open sets, which model intuitionistic logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(\def\ydash{\succ}\)This logic also has a nice sequent calculus in which sequents have one premise (or zero) and multiple conclusions. In the thread I made the claim that this is a natural and beautiful sequent calculus (it is!) but that the structure of the sequents means that the logic doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a natural conditional. The &lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt; to the conditional (subtraction) can be defined, for which \(A\ydash B\lor C\)  if and only if \(A-B\ydash C\). But the traditional conditional rules don&amp;rsquo;t work so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised, when I thought about it a bit more, that this fact is something I&amp;rsquo;ve just believed for the last 20 years or so, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen written down, so now is as good as a time, and here is as good as a place as any to explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the conditional rules in the classical sequent calculus. They look something like this (give or take variations in the presentation, all equivalent given the classical structural rules):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/classical-conditional-rules.png&#34; alt=&#34;Classical Sequent Rules for the Conditional&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Classical sequent rules for the conditional.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we restrict these rules to multiple conclusion &lt;em&gt;single premise&lt;/em&gt; sequents, we get rules which look like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/closed-set-conditional-rules.png&#34; alt=&#34;closed set logic Sequent Rules for the Conditional&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Closed set logic sequent rules for the conditional.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see an immediate issue with the [\(\supset\)&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ast;] rule. The concluding sequent is \(\ydash A\supset B,Y\) which tells you when a conditional (with alternate conclusion cases) is derivable from &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; premises. It does not tell you anything else about when a conditional (with alternate conclusion cases) is derivable from another premise. It does not tell us what to do if we want to derive \(C\ydash A\supset B,Y\) in any case where the \(C\) is doing some logical work. The best guidance we get is to ignore the \(C\) and to hope that we can derive \(\ydash A\supset B,Y\). (In classical logic, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, because we could stash the \(C\) premise away as an alternate conclusion \(\neg C\) among the \(Y\)s in the right hand side, but in an asymmetric sequent calculus like this, that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily within our powers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the rules seem too weak to constrain arbitrary sequents of the form \(C\ydash A\supset B,Y\) gives us a hint that these rules might not be strong enough to actually &lt;em&gt;characterise&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;uniquely define&lt;/em&gt; the connective \(\supset\). And that hint bears out when you attempt to derive uniqueness. Here&amp;rsquo;s the issue. Imagine that you and I both use rules like these to define a conditional connective. Yours is \(\supset_1\) and mine is \(\supset_2\). Try to derive the sequent \(p\supset_1 q\ydash p\supset_2 q\) and you&amp;rsquo;ll see that you get stuck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/attempted-identity-derivation.png&#34; alt=&#34;Attempted derivation of an identity sequent&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Attempted derivation of an identity sequent.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get stuck at just the point where we&amp;rsquo;d like to know when \(p\supset_2 q\) follows from other premises, and our rules give us no guidance at all. So, it looks as if our rules are not uniquely characterising in this sequent calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s just a suspicion. It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to have a demonstration of this fact&amp;mdash;an explanation of how it is that these rules could be interpreted in different, incompatible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way to show that the single premise / multiple conclusion conditional rules do not define a unique connective in closed set logic. We&amp;rsquo;ll use very simple algebras that are known to model closed set logic. Finite total orders. To be concrete, we&amp;rsquo;ll interpret propositions as taking values from some given subset of the interval \([0,1]\), at least including \(0\) and \(1\), so each formula \(A\) will take some value \(a\) in that set of values, and we&amp;rsquo;ll interpret a sequent \(A\ydash B_1,\ldots,B_n\) as saying that \(a\le \max(b_1,\ldots,b_n)\), which amounts to saying that \(a\le b_i\) for some \(i\). And similarly, \(\ydash B_1,\ldots,B_n\) amounts to \(1\le b_i\) for some \(i\). A sequent holds if the value of the left hand formula (or \(1\), if the formula is absent) is less than or equal to the value of one of the right hand formulas. (If the language has conjunction and disjunction, you can interpret them as \(\min\) and \(\max\) respectively, and the top and bottom values are \(0\) and \(1\).)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(What has this to do with closed set logic? An \(n+1\) valued algebra corresponds to the closed sets in the topological space of an \(n\)-element totally ordered set where the closure of a set is its upwards closure in the ordering. \(0\) is the empty set and \(1\) is the whole space.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, look at what the sequent rules for a conditional mean in this setting. Collapsing the finite set \(Y\) in the rules to a single formula \(C\) for simplicity&amp;rsquo;s sake (without any loss of generality), [\(\supset\)&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ast;]  tells us that if \(a\le\max(b,c)\) then \(1\le\max(a\supset b,c)\). That is, if \(a\le b\) or \(a\le c\) then either \(a\supset b=1\) or \(c=1\). This is to hold for all values for \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\).  A little bit of algebraic manipulation shows that this is equivalent to saying that when \(a\le b\) or \(a\lt 1\) then \(a\supset b=1\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And [\(\supset\)&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ast;] tells us that if \(1\le \max(a,c)\) and \(b\le c\) then \(a\supset b\le c\) for all  \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\). That is, if either \(1\le a\) or \(1\le c\) and \(b\le c\) then \(a\supset b\le c\). Some more  manipulation tells shows that this holds if and only if \(1\supset b\le b\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, [\(\supset\)&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ast;] and [\(\supset\)&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ast;] are satisfied in our order models when we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(1\supset b\le b\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If \(a\le b\) or \(a\lt 1\) then \(a\supset b=1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is enough to fix &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; of the values of \(a\supset b\), but it is nowhere near enough to fix all of them. They do tell us that \(a\supset b=1\) whenever \(a\lt 1\), and also, when \(a=b=1\). But the values for \(1\supset b\) are less constrained. For example these rules are satisfied by setting \(1\supset b =b\) for all \(b\). And they&amp;rsquo;re also satisfied by setting \(1\supset 1 = 1\) and \(1\supset b=0\) when \(b\lt 1\). Provided that there&amp;rsquo;s at least one extra value between \(0\) and \(1\) in the ordering, that gives us wiggle room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Two truth tables for conditionals.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder we couldn&amp;rsquo;t show that \(p\supset_1 q\) entails \(p\supset_2 q\)! In this case (when \(p\) takes the value \(1\) and \(q\) takes the value \(\frac{1}{2}\)) that inference takes us from \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \(0\). That sequent isn&amp;rsquo;t valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; what I meant when I said that the conditional rules were not so good in closed set logic. The rules tell us something about conditionals, but they are not specific or strong enough to characterise a single concept.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Typesetting Flow Graphs with tikz</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/typesetting-flow-graphs/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/typesetting-flow-graphs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In a few &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2017/a-category-of-classical-proofs-tacl/&#34;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2017/proof-identity-invariants-and-hyperintensionality/&#34;&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;em&gt;flow graphs&lt;/em&gt; to display the flow of information in proofs. These are the kinds of things that are easy to draw, but they&amp;rsquo;re not so straightforward to typeset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/flowgraph.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;a flow graph on a natural deduction proof&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A flow graph on a natural deduction proof.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re not easy to typset, because they&amp;rsquo;re an overlay over a proof. The arrows indicate the flow of information inside a proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I love the flow graph on this natural deduction proof because the &amp;ldquo;action at a distance&amp;rdquo; nature of the disjunction elimination step is called out by those two sweeping blue and green arcs&amp;mdash;the \(q\) and \(r\) assumptions are discharged by the appeal to the disjunctive conclusion \(q\lor r\). These are the only non-local informational connections in the proof. Each other arc in the flow graph is local, from a premise to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, typesetting these things is not straightforward, because the locations of the arrows are defined by typesetting the underlying proof (here, the black text) and the coloured arcs are typeset on top. How do you do that? And how do you do that in an algorithmic and structural way, focussing on the structure and not hand positioning each of the lines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the tools to typset flow graphs are readily available, at least if you use &lt;a href=&#34;http://tug.org&#34;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve written up a little document explaining how to do this, and the document and source are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/consequently/flowgraphs&#34;&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt; for you to use as you see fit. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got any questions, feedback or recommendations for how to extend the technique, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope it&amp;rsquo;s helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>With Gratitude to Raymond Smullyan</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/with-gratitude-to-smullyan/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 22:12:50 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/with-gratitude-to-smullyan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;While I was busy writing my most recent paper, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/&#34;&gt;Proof Terms for Classical Derivations&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I heard that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/raymond-smullyan-dead-puzzle-creator.html?smid=tw-share&#34;&gt;Raymond Smullyan had died at the age of 97&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/g5e54e0eo6&#34;&gt;posted a tweet&lt;/a&gt; with a photo of a page from the draft of the paper I was writing at the time, expressing loss at hearing of his death and gratitude for his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to love Professor Smullyan. I learned combinatory logic from his delightful puzzle book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Mock-Mockingbird-Raymond-Smullyan/dp/0192801422/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;To Mock a Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and he was famous for many more puzzle books like that. He was not only bright and sharp, he was also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Silent-Raymond-M-Smullyan/dp/0060674695/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;warmly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Who-Knows-Study-Religious-Consciousness/dp/0253215749/&#34;&gt;humane&lt;/a&gt;. However, the focus of my gratitude was something else. In my tweet, I hinted at one reason why I&amp;rsquo;m especially grateful for Smullyan&amp;rsquo;s genius&amp;mdash;his deep understanding of proof theory. I am convinced that his analysis of inference rules in the tableaux system for classical logic rewards repeated reflection. (See his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/First-Order-Logic-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486683702/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;First-Order Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 2, Section 1 for details.) I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain why it&amp;rsquo;s important and insightful here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;In memory of Raymond Smullyan (1919-2017), with appreciation, fondness, and a sense of loss. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/g5e54e0eo6&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/g5e54e0eo6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Greg Restall (@consequently) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/consequently/status/829517048346705921&#34;&gt;February 9, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step back a moment and think about &lt;em&gt;proof theory&lt;/em&gt;, that branch of logic which concentrates&amp;mdash;unlike model theory&amp;mdash;on the &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; definition of the core logical notions of validity, inconsistency, etc. An argument is valid if and only if &lt;em&gt;there is some&lt;/em&gt; proof from the premises to the conclusion. A set of sentences is inconsistent if and only if &lt;em&gt;there is some&lt;/em&gt; refutation of (i.e., proof of a contradiction from) that set of sentences. On the contrary, model theoretic approaches define those notions negatively. An argument is valid if and only if &lt;em&gt;there is no&lt;/em&gt; model satisfying the premises but failing to satisfy the conclusion; a set of sentences is inconsistent if &lt;em&gt;there is no&lt;/em&gt; model satisfying all of them. For proof theory to be precise, we need to know what counts as a proof. The way this is typically done in different accounts of proof (whether &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Deduction-Proof-Theoretical-Study-Mathematics/dp/0486446557/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;natural deduction&lt;/a&gt;, Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Cambridge-Theoretical-Computer-Science/dp/0521779111/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;sequent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Structural-Proof-Theory-Professor-Negri/dp/0521068428/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;calculus&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/First-Order-Logic-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486683702/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;tableaux&lt;/a&gt;), there are different rules for each different logical connective or quantifier. In well behaved proof systems, there tend to be two rules for each connective, explaining what you can deduce &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; (for example) a conjunction, and how you could make a deduction &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; a conjunction. The same for a conditional, a disjunction, a negation, a universally quantified statement, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes for a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of different rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; is then is some structured collection of statements, linked together in ways specified by the rules. You demonstrate things &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; proofs typically by showing that the feature you want to prove holds for &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; proofs (the smallest possible cases), and then you show that if the property holds for a proof, it also holds for a proof you can make out of that one by extending it by a new inference step. If you have \(9\) different rules, then there are \(9\) different cases to check. Worse than that, if you were &lt;em&gt;mad enough&lt;/em&gt; to try to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations&#34;&gt;prove something about what happens when you rearrange proofs&lt;/a&gt; by swapping inference steps around, then welcome to the world of combinatorial explosion of cases. If you have \(9\) different kinds of rules, then there are \(9 \times 9 = 81\) different cases you have to consider. There&amp;rsquo;s something inherently unsatisfying about having to consider \(81\) different cases in a proof. You have the nagging feeling that you&amp;rsquo;re not looking at this at the right level of complexity. There is no wonder that the insightful and influential proof theorist &lt;a href=&#34;http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~girard/Accueil.html&#34;&gt;Jean-Yves Girard&lt;/a&gt; complained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can see &amp;hellip; technical limitations in current proof-theory: The lack in &lt;em&gt;modularity&lt;/em&gt;: in general, neigbouring problems can be attacked by neighbouring methods; but it is only exceptionally that one of the problems will be a corollary of the other &amp;hellip; Most of the time, a completely new proof will be necessary (but without any new idea).  This renders work in the domain quite long and tedious.  For instance, if we prove a cut-elimination theorem for a certain system of rules, and then consider a new system including just a new pair of rules, then it is necessary to make a complete new proof from the beginning.  Of course 90% of the two proofs will be identical, but it is rather shocking not to have a reasonable &amp;laquo;modular&amp;raquo; approach to such a question: a main theorem, to which one could add various &amp;laquo;modules&amp;raquo; corresponding to various directions.  Maybe this is inherent in the subject; one may hope that this only reflects the rather low level of our conceptualization!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Theory-Logical-Complexity-Studies/dp/0444987150/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Proof Theory and Logical Complexity&lt;/a&gt;, pages 15 and 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of permutations of rules, the usual proof of a theorem like this would have \(n\times n\) cases where you have a proof system with \(n\) different inference rules. And if you decided to try to extend your result it to a proof system with another \(m\) rules, you not only need to prove the fact all over again for your new rules, you also need to one-by-one add the \(n\times m\) cases of interaction betwen the old rules and your new ones. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where Smullyan&amp;rsquo;s insight comes in. He divided the rules of his tableaux system for classical propositional logic into two kinds. The \(\alpha\) (linear) rules are single-premise single-conclusion rules, while the \(\beta\) (branching) rules infer a conclusion from &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; premises.  It turns out that you can prove very many things about rules operating at this level of generality.  Many features of rules are shared by &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; \(\alpha\) rules or &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; \(\beta\) rules. And in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations&#34;&gt;my paper&lt;/a&gt; I was pleased to see that the \(81\) different cases of permutations I had to consider could be simplified into \(3\) different cases. Swapping an \(\alpha\) step around an \(\alpha\) step; a \(\beta\) around a \(\beta\) and an \(\alpha\) around a \(\beta\) (and back). Instead of writing a paper where I considered \(n\) different cases out of \(81\), and leave the rest to the reader, using Smullyan&amp;rsquo;s insight I could show that any rules of the required two general shapes can be permuted around using the general schemas I formulate. Every case is covered. And what&amp;rsquo;s more, if you extend the proof system with &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; rules, provided that they are \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\) rules, the results still hold.  It&amp;rsquo;s a much better way to do proof theory. It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;modular&lt;/em&gt; proof of a theorem, in just the way that Girard hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Professor Smullyan!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>A New Paper</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 01:32:58 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2017/a-new-paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a new year, and it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new paper, so here is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/&#34;&gt;Proof Terms for Classical Derivations&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on these ideas for about a year, from some &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2016/terms-for-classical-sequents-logicmelb/&#34;&gt;rough&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2016/terms-for-classical-sequents-gothenburg/&#34;&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2016/terms-for-classical-sequents-aal-2016/&#34;&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2016/what-proofs-are-about/&#34;&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2016/proof-terms-invariants/&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; 2016, to many conversations with my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;http://standefer.weebly.com&#34;&gt;Shawn&lt;/a&gt; as I attempted to iron out the details, to many more hours in front of whiteboards, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got something I&amp;rsquo;m happy to show in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper still rough, but the ideas are all there, and I think the theorems are all correct. The paper is under 50 pages&amp;mdash;but only just! It proposes a new account of proof terms for classical propositional logic. These proof terms give a new account of what it is for one sequent derivation to represent the &amp;ldquo;same underlying proof&amp;rdquo; as another. Two derivations represent the same proof if and only if they have the same proof term. In the paper I show that two derivations have the same proof term if and only if one can be permuted into the other, using a natural class of transformations of derivations. Finally, I show that cut elimination for proof terms is confluent and strongly normalising, giving a new account of what it is to &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; a classical proof, in a way that does not collapse into triviality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example from the paper, of three derivations, with the same concluding proof term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Three derivations with the same proof term&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this looks interesting to you, please &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/&#34;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate your feedback. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Puzzle for Brandom&#39;s Account of Singular Terms</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/a-puzzle-for-bob/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 11:22:42 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/a-puzzle-for-bob/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~rbrandom/&#34;&gt;Robert Brandom&lt;/a&gt;’s inferentialism since I picked up a copy of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Making-Explicit-Representing-Discursive-Commitment/dp/0674543300/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Making it Explicit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; back in 1996.  One interesting component of Brandom&amp;rsquo;s inferentialism is his account of what it is to be a singular term. There are a number of ways to understand inferentialism, but the important point here is the centrality of &lt;em&gt;material inference&lt;/em&gt; to semantics. An inference like “Melbourne is south of Sydney, therefore Sydney is north of Melbourne” is a materially good inference. Material inferences, for Brandom, are not to be understood as grounded in a more primitive notion of logical consequence—we shouldn’t explain the inference in terms of the validity of the form “\(a\) is south of \(b\), for all \(x\) and \(y\) if \(x\) is south of \(y\) then \(y\) is north of \(x\), therefore, \(b\) is north of \(a\)” and the fact that the extra premise is common knowledge or a part of the norms governing the concepts of north and south. No, according the inferentialist, we are to explain those facts in terms of materially good inferences, and not &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, one of the distinctive features of Brandom’s inferentialism is that he takes there to be an inferentialist account of what it is for a term to be a &lt;em&gt;singular term&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;a name or other device that picks out an &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt;, rather than a &lt;em&gt;predicate&lt;/em&gt; that describes something, or some other kind of connective or modifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a one sentence slogan summarising the account of what it is to be a singular term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grammatical item is a &lt;em&gt;singular term&lt;/em&gt; if and only if the &lt;em&gt;substitution inferences&lt;/em&gt; in which that item is &lt;em&gt;materially involved&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;symmetric&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(See Brandom’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Articulating-Reasons-Inferentialism-Robert-Brandom/dp/0674006925/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Articulating Reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 4, especially Section II for details and exposition.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least three complex concepts in this slogan that require explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substitution inferences&lt;/strong&gt;: A substitution inference involving a term \(t\) is an inference from a sentence using \(t\) to a sentence found by replacing the occurrences if \(t\) in the sentence with some other term of the same grammatical type. For example, the inference from “Greg is a philosophical logician” to “Greg is a philosopher” is a substitution inference involving “philosophical logician”—the term “philosopher” is substituted is in place of “philosophical logician.” The inference “Greg is a philosophical logician” to “The author of this note is a philosophical logician” is also a substitution inference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material involvement&lt;/strong&gt;: A term is &lt;em&gt;materially involved&lt;/em&gt; in an inference if it cannot be replaced without altering the status of the inference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symmetric&lt;/strong&gt;: An inference from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; is (materially) symmetric if and only if whenever that inference is materially good, so is the converse, from &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something insightful about this. The inference from “Greg is a philosophical logician” to “The author of this note is a philosophical logician” is materially good (at least, in some contexts), if that’s good so is the converse inference. Why? Because I (Greg) am the author of this note. But the inference from “Greg is a philosophical logician” to “Greg is a philosopher” is good in the way that the converse need not be. There are clearly asymmetric material inferences resulting from the substitution of weaker predicates for stronger predicates. There don’t seem to be anything “weaker” or “stronger” singular terms. What would such things be? It really looks like there is something important going on in the difference between substitution of singular terms and the substitution of predicates (or predicate modifiers, or other grammatical units) in these inferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am struck by the following puzzle. Consider an inference like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 is a small number, therefore 22 is small number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take this is a materially good inference. Whatever standard of smallness you invoke, if 23 counts as a small number, so does 22. Why? Because 22 is smaller than 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, each inference of the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(m\) is a small number, therefore \(n\) is a small number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks materially good to me, for any numerals \(m\) and \(n\) where \(n\) names a larger number than \(m\) does. Because, as before, \(m\) is &lt;em&gt;indeed&lt;/em&gt; smaller than \(n\), and in those cases, the inference is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the converse inferences seem nowhere near as good. While &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the converse inferences might be good (I have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://davewripley.rocks&#34;&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; who take it that every inference of the form &lt;em&gt;\(m\) is small, so \(m+1\) is small&lt;/em&gt; is good), but you shouldn’t think that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them are good. If you can find a number \(n\) that is small and a larger number \(m\) that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; small, then the converse inference&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(n\) is a small number, therefore \(m\) is a small number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is not only materially bad—it has a true premise and a false conclusion. It’s as bad as an argument can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks to me to be a clear counterexample to Brandom’s account of singular terms. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerals really do look like they are singular terms. (In the formalised language of mathematics, we treat numerals as singular terms. It’s a natural thing to do.) While numbers aren’t the same sorts of objects as objects we can see or touch, measure or weigh, the terms certainly seem to act like singular terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inferences from \(n\) &lt;em&gt;is small&lt;/em&gt; to \(m\) &lt;em&gt;is small&lt;/em&gt; (where \(m\) is smaller than \(n\)) really do seem to be materially good. If we’re going to rule these out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inference from \(n\) &lt;em&gt;is small&lt;/em&gt; to \(m\) &lt;em&gt;is small&lt;/em&gt; looks for all the world like a substitution inference where \(n\) is replaced by \(m\). It would be a strange grammatical analysis to take it to not be a substitution inference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term \(n\) appears materially in the inference from &lt;em&gt;\(n\) is small&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;\(m\) is small&lt;/em&gt;. (If this inference is valid, replace \(n\) by something smaller than \(m\) to make the resulting inference invalid. Conversely if the inference is invalid, we replace \(n\) by some number smaller than \(m\), to find a valid inference.) I can’t see any way to understand material involvement if this is not a case of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These inferences, though materially valid, are not all symmetric, unless either &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; number is small or &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; number is.  But that’s to make a nonsense of our concepts of “small.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite appearances, this has nothing to do with the sorites paradox, or to do with the context sensitivity of “small.” We could have run the same argument with the inference&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 is smaller than \(N\), therefore 22 is smaller than \(N\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where \(N\) is some fixed (possibly known, possibly unknown) number, and the result would have been the same. All inferences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(n\) is smaller than \(N\), therefore \(m\) is smaller than \(N\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are materially good, in those cases where \(m\) is smaller than \(n\). And obviously, some of the converse inferences are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We could do the same with more prosaic examples, too. The inference from “Wellington is south of Melbourne” to “Wellington is south of Sydney” seems materially good, while the converse inference seems much less compelling.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this means that Brandom’s account can’t work as it stands, unless I’ve misunderstood it. Even though there aren’t &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; inferential asymmetries between singular terms, there are &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; asymmetries, relative to particular substitution inferences. Any account of the distinctive behaviour of singular terms will need to paint the distinction somewhere other than the symmetry  or asymmetry of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; substitution inferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://standefer.weebly.com&#34;&gt;Shawn Standefer&lt;/a&gt; and Kai Tanter for conversations that prompted these thoughts.)&lt;/p&gt;

They&amp;rsquo;re a bucketload of fun. The derivation below generates a proof term for the sequent \(\forall xyz(Rxy\land Ryz\supset Rxz),\forall xy(Rxy\supset Ryx),\forall x\exists y Rxy \succ \forall x Rxx\). The playing around is experimenting with different ways to encode the &lt;em&gt;quantifier&lt;/em&gt; steps in proof terms. I think I&amp;rsquo;m getting somewhere with this. (But boy, typesetting these things is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; easy.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Degree Entailment, Symmetry and Paradox</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/fde-symmetry-and-paradox/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2016 00:36:40 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/fde-symmetry-and-paradox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Talking to &lt;a href=&#34;http://entailments.net&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt; during his recent visit to Australia, I got thinking about &lt;em&gt;first degree entailment&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a puzzle, which I learned from Terence Parsons in his “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/40231701&#34;&gt;True Contradictions&lt;/a&gt;”. &lt;em&gt;First Degree Entailment&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;) is a logic which allows for truth value &lt;em&gt;gaps&lt;/em&gt; as well as truth value &lt;em&gt;gluts&lt;/em&gt;.  If you are agnostic between assigning paradoxical sentences gaps and gluts (and there seems to be no very good reason to prefer gaps over gluts or gluts over gaps if you&amp;rsquo;re happy with &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;), then this looks no different, in effect, from assigning them a &lt;em&gt;gap&lt;/em&gt; value? After all, on both views you end up with a theory that doesn&amp;rsquo;t commit you to the paradoxical sentence or its negation.  How is the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; theory any different from the theory with gaps alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I have a clear answer to this puzzle&amp;mdash;an answer that explains how being agnostic between gaps and gluts is a genuinely different position than admitting gaps alone. But to explain the answer and show how it works, I need to spell things out in more detail. If you want to see how this answer goes, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First degree entailment (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;) is a logic well suited to fixed point solutions to the paradoxes. Perhaps it is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; well suited, because it allows paradoxical sentences to be evaluated in two distinct ways: Paradoxical sentences can be assigned the value \(n\) (neither true nor false: \(\lbrace\rbrace\)) or \(b\) (both true and false&amp;mdash;or \(\lbrace 0,1\rbrace\)) equally well. Are two possible values better than one? And more importantly, is agnosticism between &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; value to assign a paradoxical sentence like the liar&amp;mdash;a stance Terence Parsons calls “agnostaletheism”&amp;mdash;any different from assigning it the truth value \(n\) instead of \(b\)? After all, on either stance, neither the liar sentence nor its negation are to be accepted. In this note, I explore the symmetry that is available in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;, and I show how agnostaletheism may be clearly distinguished from the view according to which paradoxes are simply neither true nor false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fde-and-relational-evaluations&#34;&gt;FDE and Relational Evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First Degree Entailment&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;) is a simple and elegant logic, well suited to many different applications. It can be defined and understood in a number of different ways, but for our purposes it suits to introduce it as the generalisation of classical two-valued logic according to which evaluations are no longer functions assigning each sentence of a language a truth value from \(\lbrace 0,1\rbrace\), but relations to those truth values. Relaxing the constraint that evaluations be Boolean functions means that sentences can be be &lt;em&gt;neither&lt;/em&gt; true nor false (the evaluation fails to relate the sentence to either \(0\) or \(1\)) or &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; true and false (the evaluation relates the sentence to both truth values). This generalisation allows us to interpret the  suite of connectives and quantifiers of predicate logic in a straightforward manner, generalising the traditional evaluation conditions due to Boole and Tarski as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(\def\semv#1{{[\![}#1{]\!]}}\)
Given a non-empty domain \(D\) of objects, an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;-model for a language consists of a multi-sorted relation \(\rho\) defined as follows: For each \(n\)-place predicate \(F\), \(\rho_F\) relates \(n\)-tuples of objects from \(D\) to the truth values \(0,1\). For each constant \(c\) in the language, \(\rho_c\) selects a unique object from \(D\). An assignment \(\alpha\) of values to the variables is a function from those variables to  the domain \(D\). Given an assignment \(\alpha\) and the interpretation \(\rho\) we define the semantic value \(\semv{t}_{\rho,\alpha}\) of a term \(t\) to be given by \(\rho_t\) if \(t\) is a name and \(\alpha(t)\) if \(t\) is a variable. Then, relative to each assignment \(\alpha\) we define the relation \(\rho_\alpha\) which matches formulas in the language to truth values as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((Ft_1\cdots t_n)\rho_\alpha i\) iff \(\langle \semv{t_1}_{\rho,\alpha},\ldots,\semv{t_n}_{\rho,\alpha}\rangle\rho_F i\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\land B)\rho_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 1\) and \(B\rho_\alpha 1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\land B)\rho_\alpha 0\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 0\) or \(B\rho_\alpha 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\lor B)\rho_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 1\) or \(B\rho_\alpha 1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\lor B)\rho_\alpha 0\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 0\) and \(B\rho_\alpha 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\neg A\rho_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\neg A\rho_\alpha 0\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((\forall x)A\rho_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_{\alpha[x:=d]} 1\) for every \(d\) in \(D\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((\forall x)A\rho_\alpha 0\) iff \(A\rho_{\alpha[x:=d]} 0\) for some \(d\) in \(D\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((\exists x)A\rho_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_{\alpha[x:=d]} 1\) for some \(d\) in \(D\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((\exists x)A\rho_\alpha 0\) iff \(A\rho_{\alpha[x:=d]} 0\) for every \(d\) in \(D\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only deviation from classical first order predicate logic is that we allow for truth value gaps (\(\rho\) may fail to relate a given formula to a truth value) or gluts (\(\rho\) may relate a given formula to both truth values). Indeed, these features are, in a sense, &lt;em&gt;modular&lt;/em&gt;. It is straightforward to show that if a given interpretation \(\rho\) is a partial function on the basic vocabulary of a language (if it never over-assigns values to the extension of any predicate in that language), then it remains so over every sentence in that language. Those sentences can be assigned gaps, but no gluts. Similarly, if an interpretation is decisive over the basic vocabulary of some language (it never under-assigns values to the extensions of any predicate in that language), then it remains so over every sentence of that language. These sentences can be assigned gluts, but no gaps. If an evaluation is &lt;em&gt;sharp&lt;/em&gt; (if it allows for neither gaps nor gluts in the interpretation of any predicate), then it remains so over the whole language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relational evaluations are a natural model for &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;. They show it to be an elementary generalisation of classical logic, allowing for gaps between truth values and over-assignment of those values. The interpretation of the connectives and the quantifiers remains as classical as in two-valued logic, except for the generalisation to allow for gaps and gluts between the two semantic values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fde-and-four-values&#34;&gt;FDE and four values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also see &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; in another light, not as a logic allowing for gaps and gluts between two truth values, but as a logic allowing for &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; semantic values. For clarity, we will write these four values: \(t\), \(b\), \(n\) and \(f\). We can translate between the two-valued and four-valued languages as follows. Given a relational valuation \(\rho\) we define a functional valuation \(v\) which assigns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(v(A)=t\) iff \(A\rho 1\) but not \(A{\rho} 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(v(A)=b\) iff \(A\rho 1\) and \(A\rho 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(v(A)=f\) iff \(A\rho 0\) but not \(A{\rho} 1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(v(A)=n\) iff neither \(A{\rho} 1\) nor \(A{\rho} 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows then, that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(A\rho 1\) iff \(v(A)=t\) or \(v(A)=b\), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(A\rho 0\) iff \(v(A)=f\) or \(v(A)=b\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluation relations that are partial functions can be understood as functional evaluations taking semantic values from \(t,n,f\) &amp;mdash; and the evaluation clauses in this case give us the familiar logic &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt;: Kleene&amp;rsquo;s strong three valued logic. Evaluation relations that are decisive, allowing for no gaps, can be understood as taking semantic values from \(t,b,f\) &amp;mdash; and the evaluation clauses in this case give us the familiar logic &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt;: Priest&amp;rsquo;s logic of paradox. In what follows, I will move between functional and relational vocabulary as seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(\def\ydash{\succ}\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fde-and-sequents&#34;&gt;FDE and Sequents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways we can use &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; evaluations to analyse truth and consequence in the language of first order logic. One important notion goes like this: An interpretation \(\rho\) is said to be a &lt;em&gt;counterexample&lt;/em&gt; to the sequent \(X\ydash Y\) if and only if \(\rho\) relates each member of \(X\) to \(1\) while it relates no member of \(Y\) to \(1\). In other words, an interpretation provides a counterexample to a sequent if it shows some way that the sequent fails to preserve truth. Given some set \(\mathcal M\) of evaluations, a sequent is said to be \(\mathcal M\)-valid if it has no counterexamples in the set \(\mathcal M\). We reserve the term &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;-valid for those sequents which have no counterexamples at all. A sequent is said to be &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt;-valid if it has no counterexamples among partial function evaluations, and a sequent is said to be &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt;-valid if it has no counterexamples among decisive valuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is very well known in the literature on non-classical logics&amp;mdash;see, for example (Priest &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Non-Classical-Logic-Introductions-Philosophy/dp/0521670268/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;2008, Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt;) for details. The &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; validities include all of distributive lattice logic with a de Morgan negation.  Sequents such as these
\[
\neg (A\land B)\ydash \neg A\lor \neg B\quad
 \neg (A\lor B)\ydash \neg A\land \neg B
\]
\[
\neg A\lor \neg B\ydash \neg (A\land B)\quad
\neg A\land \neg B\ydash \neg (A\lor B)
\]
\[
A\ydash\neg\neg A \quad \neg\neg A\ydash A
\]
are  &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; valid. The next sequents are not valid in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;, but they are valid in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt;:
\[
{A,\neg A\ydash~}\quad
A\lor B,\neg A\ydash B
\]
In both cases, an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; interpretation which relates \(A\) to both \(0\) and \(1\) (but which fails to relate \(B\) to \(1\)) serves as a counterexample.
Similarly, the following sequents are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; valid in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;, but they are valid in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt;:
\[
{\ydash~A,\neg A}\quad
B\ydash A\land B,\neg A
\]
In both cases, an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; interpretation which relates \(A\) to neither \(0\) nor \(1\) (but which relates \(B\) to \(1\)) serves as a counterexample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fde-theories-and-bitheories&#34;&gt;FDE, Theories and Bitheories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From sequents we move to theories. A the usual definition has it that a &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; may be defined as a set of sentences closed under a logical consequence relation. So, given some collection \(\mathcal M\) of interpretations,  \(T\) is an \(\mathcal M\)-theory if and only if whenever the sequent \(T\ydash A\) (where \(A\) is a single formula) is \(\mathcal M\)-valid, then \(A\) is a member of \(T\). \(\mathcal M\)-theories contain their own \(\mathcal M\)-consequences. We can think of theories as representing what is held to be true according to a certain stance&amp;mdash;a consequences of what is held true is also (implicitly) held true. Elsewhere (Restall 2013) I have argued that in logics like &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; we have good reason to consider not only what is held true, but what is held *un*true. Sequents give us a straightforward vocabulary for describing this. We say that the disjoint pair \(\langle T,U\rangle\) is an \(\mathcal M\)-&lt;em&gt;bitheory&lt;/em&gt; if and only if whenever the sequent \(T\ydash A,U\) (where \(A\) is a single formula) is \(\mathcal M\)-valid, then \(A\) is a member of \(T\), and whenever \(T,A\ydash U\) is \(\mathcal M\)-valid, then \(A\) is a member of \(U\). Now, \(\langle T,U\rangle\) is a pair, consisting of what is (according to that bitheory) held true (to be related to \(1\)) on the one hand and what is held untrue (to be unrelated to \(1\)), on the other.  Suppose \(\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;\subseteq\mathcal M\) is another set of interpretations. If we define \(T_{\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;}\) to be the set of all sentences true (related to \(1\)) in all \(\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;\)-interpretations and likewise \(U_{\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;}\) to be the set of all sentences untrue (not related to \(1\)) in those interpretations, then \(\langle T_{\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;},U_{\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;}\rangle\) is a \(\mathcal M\)-bitheory. Indeed, if \(\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;\) is a singleton set, consisting of one interpretation, then the bitheory \(\langle T_{\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;},U_{\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;}\rangle\) is a partition of the language, deciding every formula to be either true or untrue. If the set \(\mathcal M&amp;rsquo;\) is larger, containing interpretations which give a sentence \(A\) different verdicts, then the corresponding bitheory will no longer be a partition. If one interpretation judges \(A\) to be true, another judges it untrue, then \(A\) will neither feature in the left set nor the right set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fde-and-truth&#34;&gt;FDE and Truth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puzzle under consideration in this note arises from the behaviour of paradoxical sentences in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;. The details of the paradoxes are not important to us, but regardless, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a concrete case, the paradoxes of truth. We will consider a transparent account of truth, so let us focus on first order languages in which we have a one-place predicate \(T\) for truth. Since the truth predicate is a &lt;em&gt;predicate&lt;/em&gt;, it will apply to objects in the domain. To allow for fixed points (sentences which ascribe truth or falsity to sentences in the language, including themselves) we extend the language with quotation names for sentences in that very same language. So, for each sentence \(A\) we have a name \(\ulcorner A\urcorner\). Fixed point constructions for truth in the style of Kripke, Brady, Woodruff and Gilmore generate &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;-interpretations for a language in which the sentence \(A\) and the sentence \(T\ulcorner A\urcorner\) are assigned the same semantic values. We will call such interpretations &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;\(^T\) interpretations. The construction method for &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;\(^T\)-interpretations assigns the extension of \(T\) in stages, keeping the rest of the evaluation as given, including the denotation for constants. The details of the proof are not important to us, but one essential idea is useful: the notion of &lt;em&gt;preservation&lt;/em&gt; between evaluations. For two evaluations \(\rho\) and \(\rho&amp;rsquo;\), we have \(\rho\sqsubseteq\rho&amp;rsquo;\) if and only if whenever \(\rho\) relates an atomic formula to a given truth value \(0\) or \(1\), so does \(\rho&amp;rsquo;\). It is a straightforward induction on the complexity of formulas that this then extends to all of the formulas in the language: for any formula \(A\), if \(A\rho 0\) then \(A\rho&amp;rsquo; 0\) too, and if \(A\rho 1\) then \(A\rho&amp;rsquo; 1\) too. The evaluations \(\rho\) and \(\rho&amp;rsquo;\) may still differ, because \(\rho\) might leave a &lt;em&gt;gap&lt;/em&gt; where \(\rho&amp;rsquo;\) fills in a value, \(0\) or \(1\), or where \(\rho\) assigned only one value, \(\rho&amp;rsquo;\) might assign &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only requirement on quotation names for this fixed point construction to succeed is that quotation names for different sentences are different. This means that the construction will work &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; we take the denotation of other constants to be. So, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a language with a countable supply of constants \(\lambda,\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots\) whose denotation can be freely set however we please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; is the set of relational &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; evaluations for this language in which \(T\) is a fixed point&amp;mdash;that is, for any sentence \(A\), that sentence receives the same evaluation as \(T\ulcorner A\urcorner\). &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; can also be considered as a theory (or bitheory), if we wish to consider what holds (and fails to hold) in all such evaluations. We can do the same for &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;, when we restrict our attention to evaluations in which there are no truth value gluts or gaps respectively. Kripke&amp;rsquo;s original construction shows us how to make &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; evaluations, and the construction generalises to &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; straightforwardly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to consider the behaviour of the paradoxical sentences, let&amp;rsquo;s fix the referent of the term \(\lambda\) to be the same as the referent of  the quotation name \(\ulcorner\neg T\lambda\urcorner\), containing the term \(\lambda\) itself. It follows then that \(T\lambda\) has the same value as \(T\ulcorner\neg T\lambda\urcorner\), which has the same value as \(\neg T\lambda\). \(\lambda\) denotes a liar sentence, which says of itself that it&amp;rsquo;s not true. That is, the sentence \(\neg T\lambda\) (and its mate, \(T\lambda\)) must be assigned the value \(b\) or \(n\), since it is a fixed point for negation. The fixed point construction allows us to generate interpretations for the truth predicate in which sentences like \(\neg T\lambda\) have the value \(n\), and interpretations where those sentences have the value \(b\)&amp;mdash;in fact, one can make the fixed point construction purely in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; or in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt;&amp;mdash;and there are also mixed models in which some paradoxical sentences have the value \(n\) and others the value \(b\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if we take &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; to be an adequate &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; of truth, then it seems as if we should be agnostic about whether a liar sentence like \(\neg T\lambda\) has value \(n\) or \(b\), unless we can find some consideration which breaks the tie between them. This position was named ``agnostaletheism&amp;rdquo;, by Terence Parsons (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/40231701&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a tie-breaking consideration. If we were to be agnostic between assigning \(\neg T\lambda\) the value \(b\) and the value \(n\), this looks a lot like assigning the value \(n\). After all, according to both theories, we don&amp;rsquo;t assert \(T\lambda\) and we don&amp;rsquo;t assert its negation.  This is the puzzling question: Is there an instability in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;? Does &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; collapse into &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;symmetry-in-fde-theories&#34;&gt;Symmetry in FDE Theories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profound symmetry between gaps and gluts in first degree entailment is manifest in the behaviour of the Routley star&amp;mdash;a function on evaluations&amp;mdash;introduced by Richard and Valerie Routley in the 1970s (Routley and Routley 1972). Given an evaluation \(\rho\), we can define its &lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt; evaluation \(\rho^\ast\) as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each \(n\)-place predicate \(F\), we set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\langle d_1,\ldots,d_n\rangle\rho^\ast_F 1\) holds iff \(\langle d_1,\ldots,d_n\rangle\rho_F 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\langle d_1,\ldots,d_n\rangle\rho^\ast_F 0\) holds iff \(\langle d_1,\ldots,d_n\rangle\rho_F 1\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, an atomic formula is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; according to \(\rho{^\ast}\) if and only if to \(\rho\) it is not false, and it is &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; according to \(\rho{^\ast}\) if and only if to \(\rho\) it is not true. This means that atomic formulas which are \(t\) by \(\rho\)&amp;rsquo;s lights are also \(t\) by \(\rho^\ast\)&amp;rsquo;s, and similarly for \(f\). But a formula that is \(n\) according to \(\rho\) is \(b\) to \(\rho^\ast\), and a formula that is \(b\) according to \(\rho\) is \(n\) to \(\rho^\ast\). The dual evaluation turns gaps into gluts, and gluts into gaps, for atomic formulas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact generalises to all of the formulas in the language of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: For any formula \(A\) in the language of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(A\rho^\ast 1\) holds iff \(A\rho 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(A\rho^\ast 0\) holds iff \(A\rho 1\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact is established by a simple induction on the complexity of the formula \(A\). The crucial feature of the connectives that makes this proof work is the balance between the positive and negative conditions in an evaluation \(\rho\). For example, with conjunction we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\land B)\rho_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 1\) and \(B\rho_\alpha 1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\land B)\rho_\alpha 0\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 0\) or \(B\rho_\alpha 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can proceed as follows (assuming that the fact holds for the simpler formulas \(A\) and \(B\)), \((A\land B)\rho^\ast_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho^\ast_\alpha 1\) and \(B\rho^\ast_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold and \(B\rho_\alpha 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold, iff neither \(A\rho_\alpha 0\) nor \(B\rho_\alpha 0\) hold, iff \(A\land B\rho_\alpha 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold. We have appealed to the parallel between these two clauses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\land B)\rho_\alpha 1\) holds iff \(A\rho_\alpha 1\) and \(B\rho_\alpha 1\) don&amp;rsquo;t hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\land B)\rho_\alpha 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold iff \(A\rho_\alpha 0\) and \(B\rho_\alpha 0\) don&amp;rsquo;t hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, for example, with the existential quantifier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((\exists x)A\rho_\alpha 1\) holds iff \(A\rho_{\alpha[x:=d]} 1\) holds for some \(d\) in \(D\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((\exists x)A\rho_\alpha 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold iff \(A\rho_{\alpha[x:=d]} 0\) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold for some \(d\) in \(D\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the same form of argument applies. What holds for the existential quantifier and conjunction holds for the other connectives and quantifier of first degree entailment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excursus&lt;/em&gt;: This argument would fail if we had connectives or quantifiers in our language whose truth and falsity conditions are less well matched. For example, we could have a connective which is conjunctive with regard to truth and disjunctive with regard to falsity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\times B)\rho_\alpha 1\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 1\) and \(B\rho_\alpha 1\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\((A\times B)\rho_\alpha 0\) iff \(A\rho_\alpha 0\) and \(B\rho_\alpha 0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a evaluation \(\rho\) which relates the atomic formulas \(p\) to \(1\) only and \(q\) to \(0\) only, \(\rho^\ast\) does the same. According to both \(\rho\) and \(\rho^\ast\), \(p\times q\) is related to neither \(1\) nor \(0\), breaking the symmetry between gaps and gluts. &lt;em&gt;End of Excursus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Routley star sends relational evaluations to relational evaluations. It does not send theories to theories. It is natural to define the star of a set of sentences as follows: For any set \(S\) of formulas, \(A\in S^\ast\) if and only if \(\neg A\not\in S\). However, the dual \(T^\ast\) of a theory  \(T\)is not always itself a theory. Take, for example, the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;-theory \((\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}\) consisting of all &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;-consequences of \(\neg p\lor\neg q\) (it is the theory consisting of every sentence made true by by every evaluation \(\rho\) where either \(p\rho 0\) or \(q\rho 0\)). In particular, we have \(\neg p\lor\neg q\in (\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}\) but \(\neg p\not\in (\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}\) and \(\neg q\not\in (\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}\). Now consider the dual set \((\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}^\ast\). This is not a theory, because \(p\in{(\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}^\ast}\) (since \(\neg p\not\in(\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow})\)) and \(q\in{(\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}^\ast}\) (since \(\neg q\not\in(\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow})\)) but the conjunction is not in the set: \(p\land q\not\in{(\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}^\ast}\) (since \(\neg p\lor\neg q\in(\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow})\) ensures that \(\neg(p\land q)\in(\neg p\lor\neg q){\mathord\downarrow}\) too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is straightforward to show the following fact, relating the Routley star and &lt;em&gt;bi&lt;/em&gt;-theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: For any \(\mathcal M\)-bitheory \(\langle T,U\rangle\), the pair \(\langle \overline{U^\ast},\overline{T^\ast}\rangle\) is an \(\mathcal M^\ast\)-bitheory, where \(\overline{U^\ast}\) and \(\overline{T^\ast}\) are the sets of sentences &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in \(U^\ast\) and \(T^\ast\) respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is why: The interpretation \(\rho\) is a counterexample to \(T \ydash U\) has a counterexample iff \(\rho^\ast\) is a counterexample to \(\neg U \ydash \neg T\). It follows that \(\overline{U^\ast}\ydash A,\overline{T^\ast}\) fails at \(\rho^\ast\) iff \(\neg\overline{T^\ast},\neg A\ydash\neg\overline{U^\ast}\) fails at \(\rho\), but that means \(T,\neg A\ydash U\) fails at \(\rho^\ast\). So, \(\overline{U^\ast}\ydash A,\overline{T^\ast}\) holds in \(\mathcal M^\ast\) iff \(T,\neg A\ydash U\) holds in \(\mathcal M\). So, since \(\langle T,U\rangle\) is an \(\mathcal M\)-bitheory, we have \(\neg A\in U\), which means \(A\in \overline{U^\ast}\) as desired. The case for \(\overline{U^\ast},A\ydash \overline{T^\ast}\) to \(A\in\overline{T^\ast}\) is dual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with these facts concerning the Routley star, we can attend to the behaviour of our theories (and bitheories) with gaps and gluts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-kinds-of-incompleteness&#34;&gt;Two Kinds of Incompleteness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; can be incomplete in two distinct ways. Consider the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt;-theory consisting of every sentence true in those evaluations which relate \(p\) to \(1\) and relate \(q\) to neither \(0\) nor \(1\), and which relate \(r\) to either \(1\) or \(0\). This set of sentences contains \(p\) and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain \(\neg p\). It holds \(p\) to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. However, it is incomplete concerning \(q\) and \(r\)&amp;mdash;the theory doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain \(q\) or \(\neg q\), and it also doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain \(r\) or \(\neg r\). However, the theory has &lt;em&gt;settled&lt;/em&gt; \(q\) to be neither true nor false. (In all of the evaluations, \(q\) receives the value \(n\).) On the other hand, the value of \(r\) is &lt;em&gt;unsettled&lt;/em&gt;. In some evaluations, \(r\) is true, in others it is false.  In this way, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; allows for two different kinds of incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider theories like &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;. Recall, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; is given by all &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; evaluations for which \(T\ulcorner A\urcorner\) and \(A\) receive the same value, and  &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; is given by all &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; valuations with the same property. If we focus on the &lt;em&gt;theories&lt;/em&gt; determined by each class of valuations, we see that a liar sentence like \(T\lambda\) is &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt; in both theories. In &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;, it is because in any such valuation, \(T\lambda\) receives the value \(n\)&amp;mdash;it is never true. In &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; it is because in any such valuation, \(T\lambda\) either receives the value \(n\) or the value \(b\). In some valuations it is true (those where it is \(b\)) and in others, it fails to be true. Again, the theory is incomplete concerning \(T\lambda\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to distinguish these theories or distinguish this incompleteness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the answer will be &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;. The following fact contains the core of the reason why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: For any &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; evaluation \(\rho\), the theory determined by \(\rho\) and the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; theory determined by the two evaluations \(\rho\) and \(\rho^\ast\) are identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that \(\rho\sqsubseteq \rho^\ast\) in the case where \(\rho\) is a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; evaluation. It follows that the truths according to \(\rho\) are exactly the truths according to both \(\rho\) and \(\rho^\ast\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact &lt;em&gt;generalises&lt;/em&gt;. Consider an evaluation \(\rho\), which may involve both gaps and gluts. We can define the evaluation \(\rho^{n}\), which assigns \(n\) to any atomic formula assigned either \(n\) or \(b\) by \(\rho\), and which leaves \(t\) and \(f\) fixed. It is straightforward to see that \(\rho^{n}\sqsubseteq \rho\). We can also define the evaluation \(\rho^{b}\), which assigns \(b\) to any atomic formula assigned either \(n\) or \(b\) by \(\rho\), and which leaves \(t\) and \(f\) fixed. In this case, we have \(\rho\sqsubseteq \rho^b\). So, in general any &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; evaluation \(\rho\) is sandwiched between a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; evaluation and an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt; evaluation like so: \(\rho^n\sqsubseteq\rho\sqsubseteq \rho^b\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generalisation of our previous fact can now be stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: For any &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; evaluation \(\rho\), the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; theory determined by \(\rho^{n}\) and the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; theory determined by the two evaluations \(\rho\) and \(\rho^{n}\) are identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof is as before: Now \(\rho^n\sqsubseteq \rho\), so it follows that the truths according to \(\rho^n\) are exactly the truths according to both \(\rho^n\) and \(\rho\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the operation of sending all gaps and gluts either to &lt;em&gt;gaps&lt;/em&gt; or to &lt;em&gt;gluts&lt;/em&gt; does not disturb the logic of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: If \(\rho\) is an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; evaluation, then so are \(\rho^n\) and \(\rho^b\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way that \(\rho^n\) could fail to be an an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; evaluation is if for some formula \(A\), the values in \(\rho^n\) of \(A\) and \(T\ulcorner A\urcorner\) differ. But if values of two formulas differ in \(\rho^n\), they also differ in \(\rho\). (The same holds for \(\rho^b\), too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can state our general fact, concerning truth theories in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt;. The basic idea is that the theories are identical, since theories that take the paradoxical sentences to be \(n\) and those that are agnostic between \(n\) and \(b\) take the same claims to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. This is fair enough as far as it goes, but stated in this bald way, it does not go very far at all. The theories &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; have the same theorems&amp;mdash;they both have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; theorems. The &lt;em&gt;silent&lt;/em&gt; evaluation which sends absolutely every every formula to \(n\) is a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; (and hence, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;) evaluation, and this shows that both &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; have no theorems at all. So, merely showing that &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; share theorems does not say very much at all. We can do much better than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a set \(\mathcal M\) of evaluations, such that whenever \(\rho\in\mathcal M\) we also have \(\rho^n\in \mathcal M\). Let \(\mathcal M^n\) be the set of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; evaluations in \(\mathcal M\)&amp;mdash;so \({\mathcal M^n}\) is \(\lbrace\rho^n:\rho\in\mathcal M\rbrace\). We have the following result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: The theory \(T_\mathcal{M}\) of sentences true in all evaluations in \(\mathcal{M}\) is identical to the theory \(T_{\mathcal{M}^n}\), of sentences  in all evaluations in \(\mathcal{M}^n\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly \(T_\mathcal{M}\subseteq T_{\mathcal M^n}\). To show the converse, suppose the formula \(A\) is not in \(T_\mathcal{M}\). So, it fails to be true on some evaluation \(\rho\in\mathcal{M}\). It also fails in \(\rho^n\), which is in \(\mathcal{M^n}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if we have some &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; valuation \(\rho\) for a language without the truth predicate, and we consider the set \(\mathcal M\) of all &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; evaluations, extending \(\rho\) with a truth predicate. Here, grounded \(T\)-sentences will receive values as determined by the underlying valuation \(\rho\), while other sentences will vary among all four values, \(t\), \(f\), \(n\) and \(b\), constrained only by the requirement that \(A\) and \(T\ulcorner A\urcorner\) agree in value. The set \(\mathcal M^n\) is the subset of such evaluations in which the \(T\)-sentences receive the values \(t\), \(f\) or \(n\), not \(b\). Our fact tells us the theories of \(\mathcal M\) and \(\mathcal M^n\) are indistinguishable. At the level of theories, we cannot distinguish between paradoxical sentences determinately receiving a gap value, and agnosticism between gaps and gluts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to remain at the level of &lt;em&gt;theories&lt;/em&gt;. The sets \(\mathcal M\) and \(\mathcal M^n\) determine the same set of theorems, but they determine different sets of cotheorems. While they rule &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the same sentences, they rule out different sentences. The liar sentence \(\neg T\lambda\) is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; in some valuations in \(\mathcal M\) (those that assign it the value \(b\)) while it is true in no valuations in \(\mathcal M^n\). In all valuations in \(\mathcal M^n\) a liar sentence must receive the value \(n\), so it is true in no valuation at all.  The &lt;em&gt;untruths&lt;/em&gt; of \(\mathcal M\) differ from the untruths of \(\mathcal M^n\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we attend to bitheories, the symmetry between gaps and gluts is completely restored. For our facts concerning gaps, we have matching facts concerning gluts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: For any &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; evaluation \(\rho\), the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt; cotheory determined by \(\rho^{b}\) (the formulas \(U_{\rho^b}\) untrue in \(\rho^b\)) and the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; cotheory determined by the two evaluations \(\rho\) and \(\rho^{b}\) (the formulas \(U_{\lbrace\rho,\rho^b\rbrace}\)) are identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt;: If \(\mathcal M\) is a set of valuations where for every \(\rho\) in \(\mathcal M\) the valuation\(\rho^b\) is also in \(\mathcal M\), then the cotheory \(U_\mathcal{M}\) of sentences untrue in all evaluations in \(\mathcal{M}\) is identical to the cotheory \(U_{\mathcal{M}^b}\), of sentences untrue in all evaluations in \(\mathcal{M}^b\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetry is regained, and we can distinguish between agnostalethism concerning paradoxical sentences and those views which assign them a gap, or assign them a glut. Glut views are distinguished from agnostaletheism as &lt;em&gt;theories&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;they hold different things to be true, while gap views are distinguished from
agnostaletheism as &lt;em&gt;cotheories&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;they hold different things to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all well and good when it comes to formally distinguishing these three views of paradoxical sentences. However, the puzzle wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a puzzle about the formal development of these views. It is also a puzzle concerning what it is to &lt;em&gt;hold&lt;/em&gt; those views, and this issue remains, even if we reject the model theory and the technical devices of theories, cotheories and bitheories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assertion-and-denial-in-fde-k3-and-lp&#34;&gt;Assertion and Denial in FDE, K3 and LP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the puzzle in those terms, we should say something about the speech acts of assertion and denial, or the cognitive states of accepting and rejecting. These are the practical analogues of the theoretical and abstract notions of theory and cotheory.  To connect talk of accepting and rejecting (or assertion and denial) with logical notions, we need some kind of bridge principle. A principle I have endorsed elsewhere (Restall &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/assertiondenialparadox/&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;bridge principle 1&lt;/span&gt;: If the sequent \(X\ydash Y\) is valid, then don&amp;rsquo;t accept (or assert) every member of \(X\) and reject (or deny) every member of \(Y\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To constrain what you accept and reject in line with such a bridge principle is to maintain a kind of coherence in your cognitive state. Since \(A\lor B\ydash A,B\) is valid, you would not accept the disjunction \(A\lor B\) and reject both disjuncts \(A\) and \(B\). If (as &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt; would have it) \(\ydash C\lor \neg C\) is valid, you would not reject that instance of the law of the excluded middle. If (as &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; would have it) \(D\land\neg D\ydash\) is valid, you would not accept that contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this bridge principle at hand, we can distinguish the agnostaletheist (who uses a range of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; valuations to define validity), the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt;-theorist (who restricts her attention to &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; valuations) and the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt;-theorist (who restricts his attention to &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; valuations). The &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3&lt;/span&gt; theorist will not accept any contradiction. Contradictions are never true in any evaluation of theirs. The &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp&lt;/span&gt; theorist will never reject any excluded middle. Excluded middle disjunctions are never untrue in their evaluations. The &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde&lt;/span&gt; theorist, on the other hand, can reject excluded middles and accept contradictions. That concerns &lt;em&gt;validity&lt;/em&gt; and the first bridge principle, which amounts to a kind of coherence (or consistency) principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accept a contingent &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;, or better, the &lt;em&gt;bitheory&lt;/em&gt; \(\langle T,U\rangle\) is to constrain your acceptings and rejectings further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;bridge principle 2&lt;/span&gt;: To accept a bitheory \(\langle T,U\rangle\) is to accept each member of \(T\) and to reject each member of \(U\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This constraint is compatible with the first bridge principle if pair \(\langle T,U\rangle\) is indeed a bitheory. In that case, the sequent \(T\ydash U\) is not valid (if it were, then each formula \(A\) would be in \(T\), since \(T\ydash A,U\) is valid, and in \(U\), since \(T,A\ydash U\) is valid, but that is impossible, since \(T\) and \(U\) are, by definition, disjoint), so there is no issue with accepting all of \(T\) and rejecting all of \(U\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we consider our three different views of the truth predicate (1) &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; allowing both gaps and gluts, (2) &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; allowing only gaps, and (3) &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt; allowing only gluts as determining bitheories, we can see the difference in our acceptings and rejectings if we adopt &lt;em&gt;bridge principle 2&lt;/em&gt; for each bitheory in turn. If we accept &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;k3\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;, we reject all contradictions, even those involving the liar sentence \(T\lambda\land\neg T\lambda\). If we accept &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;lp\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;, we accept all excluded middles, including the excluded middle involving the liar: \(T\lambda\lor\neg T\lambda\). But the agnostalethic position, accepting &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;fde\(^T\)&lt;/span&gt;, commits us to neither: we are free to accept
the contradiction  \(T\lambda\land\neg T\lambda\) or to reject the disjunction  \(T\lambda\lor\neg T\lambda\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, an agnostaletheist and a gap theorist indeed agree on what to accept, but they disagree on what is to be rejected. In a similar way, an agnostaletheist and an glut theorist agree on what to reject, but they disagree on what to accept. Keeping the symmetry between accepting and rejecting in view, we have parity between gaps and gluts, and the agnostalethic position can be distinguished from its two neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/the-poster-on-my-fence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my home owning career, the picket fence outside my home sports a how-to-vote sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a change for me. I&amp;rsquo;m a member of no political party, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never encouraged my neighbours to vote in any particular way. For almost all of my life, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in safe Labor seats, from growing up in working class Brisbane to living in the inner north of Melbourne, my members of Federal Parliament have all been members of the ALP in safe seats. (Only short sojourns in Toowong and Marsfield found me in conservative territory.) My vote in my electorate hasn&amp;rsquo;t made a difference over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I think that there is much more to politics than voting. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to distribute a few votes once every few years in to record your voice about how we are governed. There are plenty of other, more effective ways to take part in our common life, both locally, and globally. Broader political action can take many different forms, beyond party politics. Different forms of political action include investigating and exposing injustice or corruption, campaigning for change, making proposals for different ways to do things, protesting, raising awareness, building alternative communities and political structures and resisting injustice—through to covert and overt struggle and revolution. Politics is a complicated business with many different strands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, given all of that, why do I have a campaign poster on my fence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This election, I’ve decided to add my small voice to the cacophony of this long election campaign—not because I have fallen in love with electoral politics, and not because I&amp;rsquo;m devoted to any of the candidates or political parties on offer. The poster on my suburban picket fence is from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://austrlaianaid.org/&#34;&gt;Campaign for Australian Aid&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature the smiling face of a political candidate, but rather, the smiling faces of a group of schoolchildren in Myanmar, who attend a school supported by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worldvision.com.au/&#34;&gt;World Vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://australianaid.org/&#34;&gt;Australian Aid&lt;/a&gt;, and the poster says “&lt;a href=&#34;https://australianaid.org/pledge&#34;&gt;Vote for Us&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/vote-for-us-large.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vote For Us—the poster on my picket fence&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;My fence and its campaign poster&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead-up to this most recent federal election has seen an &lt;a href=&#34;https://stoptheclock.org.au&#34;&gt;unprecedented cut&lt;/a&gt; in Australia&amp;rsquo;s aid budget, with the Coalition government carving yet more from its already slim allocation&amp;mdash;to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/04/budget-cut-of-224m-leaves-foreign-aid-at-record-low-say-aid-groups&#34;&gt;historic low of &lt;b&gt;0.23%&lt;/b&gt; of our Gross National Income&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when other countries &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/savage-budget-cuts-pull-australia-down-in-foreign-aid-rankings-58854&#34;&gt;manage to be significantly more generous&lt;/a&gt;. We are nowhere near our stated  target of 0.7% of GNI, and we&amp;rsquo;re getting further from it. This decline must stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can argue whether any individual aid program is the best we could do with the money, but if you want to find waste in our spending, look elsewhere. Aid programs funding education, health or agricultural intiatives in neighbouring countries—no matter how badly managed—cannot waste the kind of money we manage throw away on massive expenditure on weapons, like submarines or fighter planes. Our country&amp;rsquo;s reflex reaction to look inward, to ignore our neighbours and tighten our borders is a worrying sign, and it&amp;rsquo;s one we should resist in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m encouraging my local neighbours to keep our &lt;em&gt;country&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; neighbours in mind when they cast their votes&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t vote for a candidate or for a party that ignores our neighbours, or who places short term self interest above the interests of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the poster on my picket fence, not only because the smiling faces of the schoolkids in Myanmar are a refreshing change from the smiling faces of party candidates, but because it reminds and challenges us about our place in the world. Our political actions, whether our votes or our voices, can aim at for more than our own narrow self interest. Challenges over climate change, food insecurity, and refugee movements will only increase in the years ahead. To meet these challenges, we will need the cooperation of our neighbours.  We can start acting just a little bit more like a good neighbour now. It&amp;rsquo;s the least we could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about the Campaign for Australian Aid, visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://australianaid.org&#34;&gt;https://australianaid.org&lt;/a&gt;, and consider the wider world when you cast your vote.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Advice from Undergraduate Logic Students</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/advice-from-undergraduate-logic-students/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:49:30 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/advice-from-undergraduate-logic-students/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;Prompted by a colleague and friend (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://unimelb.academia.edu/RuthBoeker&#34;&gt;Ruth&lt;/a&gt;!), I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking students who took my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL20030/&#34;&gt;upper level&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL30043/&#34;&gt;logic subjects&lt;/a&gt; last year what they learned about &lt;em&gt;how to learn&lt;/em&gt; logic. This is helpful for me&amp;mdash;I get a better understanding of how students are learning. It&amp;rsquo;s hopefully helpful for them, too, to reflect more explicitly on how they learn. But most of all, I hope that their reflections will help students who &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/&#34;&gt;come after them&lt;/a&gt;.  After all, advice from &lt;em&gt;peers&lt;/em&gt; is fresh and direct in ways that advice from someone whose first encounter with the material was nearly 30 years &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; impressed with the answers students sent me. They&amp;rsquo;re thoughtful and insightful and I&amp;rsquo;m sure the advice will useful for future students. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share them, in case it helps you to learn logic, or to teach it to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is advice from two students from my subject &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2016/PHIL20030/&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;phil20030&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Meaning, Possibility and Paradox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is a second year introduction to modal and non-classical logic, with a little bit of philosophy of language along the way. It&amp;rsquo;s taught using &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/album/2470375&#34;&gt;video lectures&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly two hour seminar, and students work in teams on weekly to prepare for each session, and as a support and study group outside classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;advice-from-student-1&#34;&gt;Advice from &lt;em&gt;Student 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things that worked well for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;most importantly I engaged with my group heaps. We met up regularly and talked over everything, which was super helpful both in understanding the content and solving all those really tricky puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;secondly I made an effort to really understand and take notes on all the lectures (well&amp;hellip; most&amp;hellip;), pretty much all the content it assessable, or at least potentially so, and the lectures were a great way to get it learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I could have done better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;engaged more in the tutes. I often found it hard to concentrate through 2 hours of pure logic, and I let myself slip up a bit in that regard, which was a pity, because that just meant I had to re-learn what I missed without Greg there to correct me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checked my work before submitting. That is to say, I checked it, but I should have double checked it and then checked it again for good measure, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make silly mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope your new students have as much fun as I did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;advice-from-student-2&#34;&gt;Advice from &lt;em&gt;Student 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt;: One thing I recall clearly is spending far too much time at the end of the semester compiling notes so that I could have a worthwhile set for the exam. I strongly recommend students collate their notes throughout the semester, so that at the end, they can focus on applying their skills to practice questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team&lt;/em&gt;: My team was &lt;em&gt;invaluable&lt;/em&gt;, especially in working through difficult questions. The approach should be twofold: learning from others&amp;rsquo; approaches to difficult questions, and secondly, solidifying your knowledge through the process of explaining things to others. With that in mind, an effective strategy would be to allocate each member of the team some questions each week, and then meet before the class to discuss each person&amp;rsquo;s responses. In fact, I would argue that regularly utilising one&amp;rsquo;s team is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; in order to succeed in this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do I need to know?&lt;/em&gt; The content of the subject can appear to be broad, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know what to do, in order to prepare for the exam. However, the information that is uploaded each week to the LMS contains a section that summarises clearly the intended learning outcomes for the week. I recommend using this as the first part of revision&amp;mdash;ensure you know every dot point, for every week, and have notes which you understand for each dot point. Once this has been achieved, you can be confident that you have all of the core skills required in order to answer exam-style application-based questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assignments&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; can be difficult. Start them as early as possible. Answer what you can, even if the final answer eludes you. And remember to use a high degree of clarity, neatness, precise definitions and wording (try to imitate the wording of the text-book). Precision and ensuring that each step of working has been explained, is a great way to gain marks (especially when you have understood the answer conceptually, but have merely failed to elaborate upon each step on paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practice&lt;/em&gt;: Is the key to succeeding in the exam. I strongly recommend that students prepare themselves so that practice can be their priority (i.e. have their notes completed, understand the basic concepts, so that at the end of the semester, they have the opportunity to do every practice question from the past exams). Furthermore, upon completing each question, I would recommend turning the answer into a set of notes, by placing an explanation of the working, next to the answer. This way, the next time a similar question comes up, you can refer to your notes, to refresh the concepts that are needed in order to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is advice from three third year students, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL30043/&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;phil30043&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Power and Limits of Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is a third year introduction to the metatheory of classical first order predicate logic, taking students from soundness and completeness to G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s incompleteness theorems and L&amp;ouml;b&amp;rsquo;s Theorem. It&amp;rsquo;s taught using &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/album/2262409&#34;&gt;video lectures&lt;/a&gt; a weekly two hour seminar, and students work in teams on weekly to prepare for each session, and as a support and study group outside classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;advice-from-student-3&#34;&gt;Advice from &lt;em&gt;Student 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definitely&lt;/em&gt; make sure you understand and be comfortable with the initial foundation part of the course before even attempting to understand the more difficult components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are having trouble with a concept, use &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;YouTube&lt;/em&gt;. There are plenty of resources out there that try to explain logic concept in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms with pictures and diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;advice-from-student-4&#34;&gt;Advice from &lt;em&gt;Student 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to not get too bogged down by symbol pushing and notation. At least until we got to the last bit (Löb&amp;rsquo;s theorem, Godel&amp;rsquo;s First and Second Incompleteness Theorems) I found that making simple pictures really helped to distill complex concepts into nice digestible chunks. This also saves a lot of writing time when it comes to making those exam notes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the videos before class and don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;spray and pray&amp;rsquo; the LMS questions. Also work hard to participate during seminars (this is something I didn&amp;rsquo;t do enough of) and give everyone a chance to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;advice-from-student-5&#34;&gt;Advice from &lt;em&gt;Student 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the subject, start compiling one big document with all your notes for each topic. This will greatly help come exam time, when you already have your pages of notes to take in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes should be updated each week&amp;hellip;and it’s really important that you keep up your understanding as you go, and make sure things make sense as you go. This is for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s really not possible to ‘cram’ in way it is for many other subjects, seeing as a large part of the material is just understanding very difficult concepts. It’s very hard to get your head around concepts like these in a short period of time. Gradual learning with plenty of breaks helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that having learnt a topic you will have a few burning questions or uncertainties about it. The best case scenario is that you can just ask these at the next seminar. If it’s the night before the exam, you may have less luck. Particularly the last third or so of the course is conceptually quite difficult. It will help to be on top of everything at this point! That said, make sure you nail the more concrete and straightforward aspects, for example Hilbert Proofs, or DNF. These just require practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the two ways I found to maintain passion and interest in the subject are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re on top of the subject, the seminars are much more enjoyable, and you’ll get more out of them. They’re not recorded, so you really have to make the most of them at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking about the bigger picture&lt;/em&gt;. The philosophical significance of the things you are talking about is often very exciting. It’s a very fun subject! There are very few other areas of philosophy or the arts more generally that are so rigorous that proofs can be used. Enjoy yourself!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Models for Compatibility</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/models-for-compatibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 16:57:01 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/models-for-compatibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning I received an email from &lt;a href=&#34;https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/rachael-briggs&#34;&gt;Rachael Briggs&lt;/a&gt;, asking me some questions about the notion of &lt;em&gt;compatibility&lt;/em&gt; as it appears in my paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;Negation in Relevant Logics&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; These questions got me to thinking that there were some ideas in &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?cites=3319676480145120321&amp;amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;that paper&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?cites=828496633310229772&amp;amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;much-less-read&lt;/a&gt; paper of mine &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/modelling/&#34;&gt;Modelling Truthmaking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which might be worth reflecting on some more. So I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the background you need to get up to speed. &lt;em&gt;Relevant&lt;/em&gt; logics attempt to make sense of the idea that if an argument from premises \(\Sigma\) to conclusion \(A\) is valid then the premises must somehow be &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; to the conclusion. If the \(A\) is a tautology by itself (say, \(p\lor\neg p\)) then that fact alone is not enough to ensure that it follows &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the unrelated premise \(q\). \(p\lor\neg p\) follows well enough from \(p\) (a disjunction follows from a disjunct), and from \(\neg p\) (the other disjunct), but if \(q\) has nothing to do with it, we can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily get to \(p\lor\neg p\) from there. The same goes for arguments from contradictory premises. \(p\land\neg p\) is inconsistent. &lt;em&gt;Classical&lt;/em&gt; logic tells us that the argument from \(p\land\neg p\) to \(q\) is valid because there&amp;rsquo;s no interpretation to make \(p\land\neg p\) true that makes \(q\) false—but that&amp;rsquo;s not because of any connection between \(p\land\neg p\) and \(q\). There&amp;rsquo;s no such interpretation because of features of \(p\land\neg p\) all by itself. So that&amp;rsquo;s one way to understand some of the design goals for relevant logics: give us an understanding of logical consequence according to which there are genuine connections between premises and conclusions of valid arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way that relevant logicians have explained this connection is by stretching the notion of an &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; (or a &lt;em&gt;situation&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;set-up&lt;/em&gt;) so that we allow for interpretations to be incomplete or inconsistent. So, even though we might agree that it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;tautology&lt;/em&gt; that \(p\lor\neg p\), that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that every &lt;em&gt;situation&lt;/em&gt; determines that \(p\lor\neg p\). One way to view things is this: no matter how the world arranges itself, it will either make \(p\) true, or if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it makes \(\neg p\) true, so however it goes, it&amp;rsquo;s unavoidable that \(p\lor\neg p\). However, this does not mean that every part of the world contributes equally. Either there is beer in my refrigerator, or there is not. The situation consisting of what is going on in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; immediate vicinity doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide this one way or another. A situation including my refrigerator (and enough of the network of social conditions required to see to it that this refrigerator is my refrigerator, I suppose) is what we need to settle the matter, and to see to it that either there is beer there, or there isn&amp;rsquo;t. And that is enough to decide the matter, no matter how things go. Attention to the detail of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; things are made true, in addition to &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; they are made true, seems to help with making the distinctions needed for relevant connections. (I say more on this in my paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ten&#34;&gt;Truthmakers, Entailment and Necessity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Go there for more details.) You can see why this sort of thing is in the air these days, when analytic metaphysicians are interested in notions of grounding and dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;Negation in Relevant Logics&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; I was interested in the following question: how are we to understand how &lt;em&gt;negation&lt;/em&gt; works in this sort of setup? It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to admit incomplete scenarios (how your part of the world won&amp;rsquo;t determine the contents of my refrigerator, etc), it&amp;rsquo;s another to actually understand how negation works in these scenarios. When is \(\neg A\) made true by a situation? Given that situations allow for things that consistent and complete totalities like worlds don&amp;rsquo;t, we can&amp;rsquo;t say the natural world-like classical thing, according to which \(\neg A\) is true in a situation just when \(A\) isn&amp;rsquo;t true in that situation. No, we want to allow for situations with gaps (where \(A\) and \(\neg A\) both fail to be made true by a situation), and for the advanced relevantists, we&amp;rsquo;d also like to make room for &lt;em&gt;gluts&lt;/em&gt;, which are situations in which we might both have \(A\) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; \(\neg A\) true. These situations might be &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; (at least, they&amp;rsquo;re inconsistent), but nonetheless, I argued in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;Negation in Relevant Logics&lt;/a&gt;”
 that there is good reason to admit them into our menagerie of situations as different impossibilities—different ways that parts of the world &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how are we to understand how negation works among these situation? I followed some work by J.&amp;nbsp;Michael Dunn on different formal semantics for negation (the lovely &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2214128&#34;&gt;Star and Perp&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; paper), and argued that the kind of &amp;ldquo;perp&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;incompatibility&amp;rdquo; semantics he considered there could make a great deal of sense in the context of incomplete and inconsistent situations. The idea is simple. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;my paper&lt;/a&gt; I phrased things positively, in terms of a binary relation of &lt;em&gt;compatibility&lt;/em&gt; between situations, where \(sCt\) iff situation \(s\) is compatible with \(t\). Given compatibility, we interpret negation in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(s\vDash\neg A\) if and only if for every \(t\) where \(sCt\), \(t\not\vDash A\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a situation (say, the situation consisting of my kitchen as it is) makes it true that there is no beer in my fridge if and only if every situation compatible with my kitchen as it is &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; make it true that there is beer in my fridge. My kitchen as it is does the job of &lt;em&gt;ruling out&lt;/em&gt; the presence of beer in the fridge by rendering any beer-in-my-fridge scenarios as incompatible with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds fair enough. If the kitchen situation does make it true that there is no beer in my fridge, then the beer-in-my-fridge situations do seem incompatible with it, and if my kitchen situation doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it true that there&amp;rsquo;s no beer in my fridge, then there is some situation compatible with it, according to which there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; beer in my fridge. (Perhaps this is that situation itself, but perhaps you can think of wilder scenarios according to which my kitchen doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it true by itself that there is beer in my fridge, but a larger part of the world makes it true.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this seems fair enough. There are more details to be worked out about the behaviour of compatibility, and in particular, inconsistent scenarios, and I do some of that in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;Negation in Relevant Logics&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; The important point for relevant logics is that compatibility does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; reduce to joint consistency. That is, we may have a situation \(s\) that is itself inconsistent (that is, \(s\) incompatible with itself, we don&amp;rsquo;t have \(sCs\)) while we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have \(sCt\) for some other situation \(t\). How could that happen? One way to think about it is this: we have our situation \(s\) which is confused about &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; things, and not confused about others. The situation \(t\) gives us &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; information about the things \(s\) is confused about, and is compatible with the other information given by \(s\), and perhaps it gives information about things left out by \(s\). In this way, there is no clash &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; \(s\) and \(t\). There is no claim on the world made by \(s\) that is opposed in any way by \(t\). However, \(s\) makes claims that clash with itself. There is a fundamental tension &lt;em&gt;in \(s\)&lt;/em&gt;, while there is none between \(s\) and \(t\). This seems to me to be an appropriate and natural way to understand compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so I claim in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;Negation in Relevant Logics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. However, this leaves me with the thought that compatibility understood in this way is perhaps useful when it comes to giving an understandable interpretation of a relevant account of consequence involving negation, but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not particularly natural. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to make this thought clear, because it&amp;rsquo;s an aesthetic judgement of the mathematician. A notion is natural if it makes a distinction worth drawing—and one way to see that it does make a worthwhile distinction is that it comes up again and again in different places, and can be understood in different ways. (For those of you who know modal logic, for natural think S4. For non-natural, think S3. S4 comes up again and again and again in different scenarios—intuitionist logic, topological spaces, etc. S3 is nowhere.) The more independent grasp we can get on compatibility, the better for the notion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s one reason I wrote the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/modelling/&#34;&gt;Modelling Truthmaking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, though negation and compatibility wasn&amp;rsquo;t the concept I was attempting to understand. Thinking about Rachel&amp;rsquo;s questions about how to understand compatibility, however, I realised that there are ideas in that paper that are worth revisiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core idea is to attempt to understand a notion of compatibility between situations which arises naturally out of the structure of the situations themselves, and in a way that makes compatibility act in just the way that the relevant logician takes it to act (allowing for incomplete and inconsistent situations). The conceit of the paper is to imagine a little digital world where we have an infinite discrete Cartesian plane, where each unit on the plane is either &lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Off&lt;/strong&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; is any total function from positions to {&lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;Off&lt;/strong&gt;} (so, in a world, every spot on the plane takes one and only one value). A &lt;em&gt;situation&lt;/em&gt; more general: for each position, a situation may remain agnostic (give &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; value), or be determinate (give &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; value), or be overdetermined (give &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;). Situations can be incomplete or inconsistent about different parts of the world.  Once we have this notion of situations, compatibility between situations is very straightforward to define: situation \(s\) clashes with situation \(t\) if and only if there is some part of the map where they give conflicting information, where \(s\) says &lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt; and \(t\) says &lt;strong&gt;Off&lt;/strong&gt;, or vice versa. In the absence of such a conflict between \(s\) and \(t\) they are compatible. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow, of course, that \(s\) and \(t\) are jointly consistent, because either \(s\) or \(t\) might be inconsistent all on their own. This still seems to me to be a very natural model, and one where the notion of compatibility favoured by the relevantist is completely appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this model again today, I realised that it generalises to much more realistic views of situations, in such a way that the features of compatibility are preserved. While the digital plane of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/modelling&#34;&gt;Modelling Truthmaking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; made for nice diagrams, it is inessential to the argument of the paper. So, too, was the rabid Humeanism and atomism according to which a world is made up of &amp;ldquo;a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact, just one little thing and then another&amp;rdquo; (David Lewis, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/On-Plurality-Worlds-David-Lewis/dp/0631224262/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;On the Plurality of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, p. ix). If we generalise the picture so that we have a set \(L\) of &lt;em&gt;locations&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps these are points in spacetime, perhaps they are points in some higher phase space, and perhaps they are something else entirely), and another set \(F\) of &lt;em&gt;features&lt;/em&gt;, such that some are &lt;em&gt;unary&lt;/em&gt; (borne by a location) others are &lt;em&gt;binary&lt;/em&gt; (these features &lt;em&gt;relate&lt;/em&gt; two locations), and so on. The set \(F\) of features is structured so that some combinations of features &lt;em&gt;clash&lt;/em&gt;. In the case of the simple model of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/modelling&#34;&gt;Modelling Truthmaking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, the clash was straightforward: &lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt; clashed with &lt;strong&gt;Off&lt;/strong&gt;. In the more general case, more possibilities are available. Perhaps there are three unary features, and locations can have any two of them but not three. Or perhaps only locations which have a particular feature are candidates for having another. The particular details don&amp;rsquo;t matter at all for the definition of compatibility. Let&amp;rsquo;s define a &lt;em&gt;situation&lt;/em&gt; to be a mapping from each location (and pair of locations, etc., up the arities of the features in \(F\)) to the (possibly empty) set of features had by that location, pair locations, etc. A situation is self-compatible if none of its own assignments of features clashes. (I&amp;rsquo;ll leave aside the question of when it is that a situation is &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt;, as that&amp;rsquo;s not needed for the point at hand.) When is a situation \(s\) compatible with \(t\)? When no values \(s\) assigns clash with anything assigned by \(t\). How can we understand this? In just the same way as in the &lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;Off&lt;/strong&gt; world, except we generalise. In that world, a clash was found when \(s\) assigned something &lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt; that \(t\) assigned &lt;strong&gt;Off&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt;). In a more complicated feature space, it is harder to state, but the idea is the same: two situations \(s\) and \(t\) are compatible where there is no clash between the locations involved in \(s\) and those involved in \(t\). The notion of compatibility that this determines still works as the relevantist wants (situation \(s\) might be inconsistent, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it must have some beef with \(t\), which only determines a completely different collection of locations), and the phenomenon is much more general than the dessicated Humean digital world of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/modelling&#34;&gt;Modelling Truthmaking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that models like this are useful for at least two things. First, they can help us see what could be  involved in talk of situations and compatibility—they can help us test and train different ideas of how things might go, and what could come out of such notions in particular concrete cases. They provide a relatively concrete test case, in which conjectures can be tested and tried out. Second, they can give us ideas of how the formal ideas of logic and semantics can be applied and related to different metaphysical views of properties and their bearers. Given the resurgence of thinking about grounding and dependence, it seems to me that these ideas are worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a href=&#34;https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/rachael-briggs&#34;&gt;Rachael&lt;/a&gt;, for the questions, and for prompting this line of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Rachael isn&amp;rsquo;t just a great philosopher. She&amp;rsquo;s also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://cordite.org.au/reviews/royal-briggs/&#34;&gt;fine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://cordite.org.au/guncotton/plunkett-briggs/&#34;&gt;poet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Congratulations to Bruce French, AO</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 00:30:47 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2016/congratulations-bruce-french-ao/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from home in Auckland at a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/fnclmp/&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; over the last couple of days, so I&amp;rsquo;m a bit behind on the news, but tonight I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a few moments to write something in honour of my friend and mentor, Bruce French, who was&amp;mdash;three days ago&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-26/australia-day-award-recipient-edible-plants-website/7114476&#34;&gt;named an Officer of the Order of Australia&lt;/a&gt; in the 2016 Australia Day Honour&amp;rsquo;s list. Bruce was awarded this honour because of his many decades of work, learning about tropical food plants throughout the Pacific, Asia and Africa, cataloguing that knowledge and making it &lt;a href=&#34;http://foodplantsinternational.com&#34;&gt;freely available to anyone who can use it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/zac-bruce.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bruce French with a young friend&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Bruce French with a young friend, in 2012&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve known Bruce since my second year at university, many years ago. During this time, I was involved in a student Christian group, and Bruce worked there with students, encouraging them to explore both their university studies and their faith in equal measure. Bruce had trained as an agricultural scientist, and as a Baptist pastor, and his enthusiasm for tropical plants, and his passion for loving God and loving his neighbour was infectious. Before coming to work at the University, Bruce had spent time in Papua New Guinea, and he&amp;rsquo;d seen both the incredible knowledge that indigenous people had for the opportunities for nutrition in the plants around them, and the devastating damage done by well-meaning but ignorant attempts at aid in times of famine, where inappropriate Western foodstuffs would be introduced, when local options were much more appropriate to the climate and the nutritional needs of community. From then on, Bruce devoted himself to finding out more about the tropical food plants, and making sure that local knowledge would be treasured and cared for rather than ignored. This devotion has resulted in a database of over &lt;a href=&#34;http://foodplantsinternational.com/plants/&#34;&gt;27,000 edible plant species&lt;/a&gt;, a treasure which will become only more important in times of increasing food insecurity as the climate is under more pressure in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d say that Bruce&amp;rsquo;s devotion to this cause over the last 50 years was remarkably foresighted, but I think that this would be selling things short. From my experience, this interest was not a quirk of interest or a strange happenstance&amp;mdash;it was the natural outworking of Bruce&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and talents together with his character and values. Bruce always described his passion in terms of his love for God and God&amp;rsquo;s world, and for his neighbours&amp;mdash;and whether he was working with University students in the 1980s and 1990s, or local villagers in PNG, the Pacific Islands, Asia or Africa, that love was shown in a patient attention and listening to others, an openness to what he had to learn from them. As Bruce would describe it, they are just as much God&amp;rsquo;s children as he is, and he has as much&amp;mdash;if not more&amp;mdash;to learn about God&amp;rsquo;s world from them than they might from him. This treasure trove of information is there for all of us to share, and to use is the fruits of many years of listening and learning, exploring and explaining. This indformation will become more and more useful in times of environmental stress in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my own years at University, Bruce was a valued example, a mentor and friend. His advice and encouragement was invaluable when I struggled with the decision over staying in mathematics or moving to philosophy, and he has been a steady guide and sounding board at other life transitions since then.  While I never quite shared his passion for tropical plants, I hope and pray that I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired just &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of that attentive love for others, that passion for learning, and for sharing what we&amp;rsquo;ve found so that all may flourish. One of Bruce&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; passions was the Hebrew prophets, and one verse he often repeats is Micah 6:8.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a recent visit from &lt;a href=&#34;http://entailments.net&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt;, I was reminded of a critical discussion between Jc and our colleague and friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://grahampriest.net&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt; in the pages of &lt;a href=&#34;http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Jc was puzzled by a claim that Graham made &lt;a href=&#34;http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/4/739.extract&#34;&gt;in his reply&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/3/517.abstract&#34;&gt;Jc&amp;rsquo;s paper&lt;/a&gt;, concerning nonmonotonic consequence relations and failures of truth preservation. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the disagreement between Jc and Graham, and why Graham&amp;rsquo;s claim (that all nonmonotonic logics fail to preserve truth) is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on March 9, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;: I submitted a version of this note to the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%292161-2234&#34;&gt;Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and it has been accepted for publication. The prepublication version of the paper is archived &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/on-priest-on-nonmonotonic/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-classical logics aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes this fact seems like a feature: paraconsistent logics like Priest&amp;rsquo;s \(LP\) reject disjunctive syllogism and &lt;em&gt;ex contradictione quodlibet&lt;/em&gt; and so, they give us new and fruitful ways to deal with semantic paradoxes unavailable to proponents of classical logic. However, sometimes this fact seems like a bug: there are times we want to endorse those particular rules of proof, not reject them. Priest&amp;rsquo;s favoured way out of this tension is to adopt a nonmonotonic logic, \(LPm\).  According \(LPm\), inference steps such as disjunctive syllogism&amp;mdash;from \(p\lor q\) and \(\neg p\) to \(q\)&amp;mdash;may be valid, while becoming invalid in the presence of extra premises: in particular, premises which are inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise details of how \(LPm\) manages to be nonmonotonic are not important to us. A sketch will suffice to explain what is going on. Models for \(LP\) and \(LPm\) assign truth (\(1\)) or falsity (\(0\)) or possibly &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; to each atomic proposition. An argument is \(LP\) valid if every model that assigns the premises to be true (perhaps some premises are false too, perhaps they are not) also renders the conclusion true. For \(LPm\) we relax this condition. We need not check every model&amp;mdash;in particular, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to check the models that assign both \(1\) and \(0\) to many different propositions. We check models that are as inconsistent as they need to be to make the premises true. (These are the &lt;em&gt;minimally inconsistent&lt;/em&gt; models, and that is where the &amp;ldquo;\(m\)&amp;rdquo; comes from in &amp;ldquo;\(LPm\)&amp;ldquo;.) If in every such model where the premises are true, so is the conclusion, then the argument is \(LPm\) valid. So, disjunctive syllogism in the shape of the argument from \(p\lor q\) and \(\neg p\) to \(q\) is \(LPm\)-valid, since there are completely consistent models in which the premises are true (these are the consistent model in which \(p\) is false but \(q\) is true), and in these models, the conclusion \(q\) is indeed true. We can disregard models in which \(p\) is both true and false, as we never need \(p\) to be inconsistent to make the premises true. If we add the premise \(p\land \neg p\), then the models that make the premises true have to be inconsistent about \(p\). The models in which \(p\) is both true and false and \(q\) is false only is no better and no worse than models in which \(p\) is both true and false and \(q\) is true only. But the models like this in which \(q\) is false are counterexamples to the argument—they make the premises true and the conclusion false, so adding the inconsistency of \(p\) as an extra premise renders the new argument &lt;em&gt;invalid&lt;/em&gt; in \(LPm\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of Priest&amp;rsquo;s work in paraconsistent logic uses the relatively traditional, monotonic logic \(LP\) rather than the stronger nonmonotonic logic \(LPm\). Many theories which are trivial in the context of classical logic (in the sense that there are no models at all, and everything follows from the axioms of the theory) are non-trivial in \(LP\). This gives rise to the concern that since \(LPm\) is stronger than \(LP\), some of the theories which are non-trivial in \(LP\) may be trivial when viewed through the lens of \(LPm\). Priest proves (2006, page 226) that Reassurance indeed holds for \(LPm\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper, Beall (2012) argues that this Reassurance theorem is not enough to be genuinely reassuring. He claims that we should want what he calls &lt;em&gt;General Reassurance&lt;/em&gt;: if the \(LP\) consequences of some set of premises are true, so are the \(LPm\) consequences of that set. In reply to Beall, Priest (2012) argues that General Reassurance is too much to ask of \(LPm\) of or any nonmonotonic logic. He writes (2012, page 740)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Reassurance&lt;/em&gt;, however, is too much to ask. \(LPm\) is a nonmonotonic (aka inductive) logic. And it is precisely the definition of such logics that they may lead us from truth to untruth. The point is as old as Hume (&amp;lsquo;The sun has risen every day so far. So the sun will rise tomorrow.&amp;rsquo;) and as new as that much over-worked member of the spheniscidae (&amp;lsquo;Tweety is a bird. So Tweety flies.&amp;rsquo;) If they did not have this propert, these logics would be deductive logics, which they are not. This is not a bug of such logics; it is a feature. Such logics do not preserve truth, by definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not attempt to adjudicate the disagreement between Priest and Beall on the virtues of General Reassurance—this would require settling what the consequence relation of \(LPm\) is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, and that is beyond the scope of this note. Here, I have a simpler point to make. Priest&amp;rsquo;s characterisation of the relationship between non-deductive, non-truth-preserving logics and nonmonotonic logics is mistaken, and I will explain why, giving examples of truth preserving nonmonotonic logics. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve presented the counterexamples to Priest&amp;rsquo;s claim, I will attempt to diagnose his error, and explain why one might reasonably, but mistakenly, take it that a nonmonotonic logic is never truth preserving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&amp;star;&amp;nbsp;&amp;star;&amp;nbsp;&amp;star;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be careful to define our terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consequence relation \(\vDash\) is &lt;em&gt;nonmonotonic&lt;/em&gt; if there are valid arguments from premises \(\Sigma\) to conclusion \(C\) (\(\Sigma\vDash C\)) such that there is some extra premise \(B\) where the argument from \(\Sigma\) together with \(B\) to \(C\) fails to be valid (\(\Sigma,B\not\vDash C\)).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consequence relation \(\vDash\) is &lt;em&gt;non-truth-preserving&lt;/em&gt; (or &amp;lsquo;inductive&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;non-deductive&amp;rsquo;) if there is some valid argument from premises \(\Sigma\) to conclusion \(C\) (\(\Sigma\vDash C\)) where each premise in \(\Sigma\) is true and the conclusion \(C\) is false.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that these definitions use different concepts. It would be surprising for them to coincide, and in fact it is not hard to find examples of nonmotonotonic but truth preserving consequence relations. (It is even easier to find monotonic logics that fail to preserve truth. Consider the &amp;lsquo;consequence relation&amp;rsquo; for which an argument is &amp;lsquo;valid&amp;rsquo; if whenever the premises all contain the letter &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; so does the conclusion. This is monotonic, but it fails to preserve truth.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example 1&lt;/em&gt;: Not all friends of paraconsistent logics are dialetheists. You can reject the inference from a contradiction to an arbitrary conclusion, without taking any contradictions to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. Nonetheless, there are &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; in which contradictions are true. Those models represent different ways that things can&amp;rsquo;t be (Restall 1997). For a paraconsistentist who takes contradictions to be semantically distinct (and to have different consequences) but nonetheless all impossible, the logic \(LPm\) is truth preserving. If all possible worlds are consistent and complete, then any \(LPm\)-valid argument leads from truths only to other truths, and necessarily so, for any world there is a consistent \(LPm\) model assigning \(1\) to each truth and \(0\) to each falsehood of the language, so if the premises of an \(LPm\)-valid argument are true in some possible world, the conclusion must be true too, since the model appropriate to that world is as minimally inconsistent as you can get—it is actually &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the logic is now truth preserving, but it remains nonmonotonic. While disjunctive syllogism is \(LPm\) valid, the addition of the inconsistent premise renders the argument invalid. The model that delivers the invalidity is not a &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; for the non-dialethic paraconsistentist. It represents a way that things cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Priest is a dialetheist, so while he should agree that the nondialethic paraconsistentist can take \(LPm\) to be a truth preserving nonmonotonic logics (and so, this is enough to show that being nonmonotonic alone is not enough to be non-truth-preserving), dialetheists can&amp;rsquo;t use that example for themselves. However, it&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to make examples that are dialethically acceptable to make the same point. If the actual world is inconsistent about some things but not others (say, for the actual world we require inconsistency over &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; part of our vocabulary, \(\mathcal L_1\) and not the rest, \(\mathcal L_2\)), then take the &amp;lsquo;baseline&amp;rsquo; for inconsistency to be models that are inconsistent only in \(\mathcal L_1\) but not in \(\mathcal L_2\), and grade models which allow for more or less inconsistency in the \(\mathcal L_2\) vocabulary. The resulting consequence relation is now truth preserving but still nonmonotonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example 2&lt;/em&gt;: Consider models for counterfactuals that use a similarity relation on worlds, in the style of Lewis or Stalnaker. A conditional \(A &amp;gt; B\) is true at world \(w\) if in the worlds worlds &lt;em&gt;most similar&lt;/em&gt; to \(w\) where \(A\) is true, so is \(B\).  Let&amp;rsquo;s say that an argument from premises \(\Sigma\) to conclusion \(C\) is \(\mathit{Cf}\)-valid if the conditional \(\bigwedge \Sigma &amp;gt; C\) is true. These conditionals are famously nonmonotonic. (The closest worlds where I have a cup of coffee before 7am are not the closest worlds where I have a cup of coffee with added arsenic before 7am.) However, \(\mathit{Cf}\)-valid arguments are truth preserving, given the plausible assumption (shared by Lewis, Stalnaker and others who take this approach to counterfactual conditionals) that a world \(w\) is one of the closest worlds to itself. Here is why. Suppose the argument from \(\Sigma\) to \(C\) is \(\mathit{Cf}\)-valid, and that each sentence in \(\Sigma\) is true. We want to show that \(C\) is true too. Since the argument is \(\mathit{Cf}\)-valid, at the actual world, the conditional \(\bigwedge\Sigma&amp;gt; C\) is true. Since the actual world is one of the closest worlds to itself, and since \(\bigwedge\Sigma\) is true at the actual world, \(C\) is true there too, as desired. This (contingent, non-formal) &amp;lsquo;logic&amp;rsquo; of conditional consequence gives us another example of a nonmonotonic but truth preserving consequence relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples 3, 4, &amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: You can make arbitrarily more examples of nonmonotonic and truth preserving logics using a simple template. Given a monotonic consequence relation \(\vDash\) defined in terms of truth preservation with some class \(M\) of models, in which we have settled in advance that the actual world represented by some model in a subclass \(W\) of \(M\). (In &lt;em&gt;Example 1&lt;/em&gt;, \(W\) is the class of consistent \(LP\) models. In &lt;em&gt;Example 2&lt;/em&gt;, it is the class containing all worlds most similar to the actual world.) We enrich our interpretation with a well-founded preorder relation \(\sqsubseteq\), according to which each member of \(W\) is minimal according to that relation&amp;mdash;for each \(w\in W\) there is no \(v\in M\) where \(v\sqsubseteq w\) but \(w\not\sqsubseteq v\).  (The well-foundedness condition ensures that every nonempty subset of \(M\) has elements that are \(\sqsubseteq\)-minimal in \(M\).) Define the non-monotonic consequence relation \(\vDash^* \) by setting \(\Sigma\vDash^* C\) if the \(\sqsubseteq\)-least models in which each element of \(\Sigma\) is true also make \(C\) true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence relation \(\vDash^* \) is truth preserving by design. If \(\Sigma\vDash^* C\) and the members of \(\Sigma\) are true, then there is some model in \(W\) (the model of the actual world, which makes true all and only the true sentences), in which the members of \(\Sigma\) hold. Since this model is in \(W\) it is minimal with respect to \(\sqsubseteq\) and since \(\Sigma\vDash^* C\), then \(C\) holds at that model too, and so, it is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to do a little more work to show that \(\vDash^*  \) is not monotonic. For that we need some information about the language and the class \(M\) of models and its subset \(W\). If there is an argument in our language from \(\Sigma\) to \(C\) that has no counterexamples among &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; (in \(W\)) but has some counterexample in a model \(m\) outside \(W\), then if we have some sentence \(B_m\) true at \(m\) but not true at any world in \(W\), our argument will be a counterexample to monotonicity&amp;mdash;we have \(\Sigma\vDash^* C\) but we don&amp;rsquo;t have \(\Sigma,B_m\vDash^* C\), since there is some model \(\sqsubseteq\)-minimal among models in which \(\Sigma,B_m\) are true and \(C\) is untrue, since \(m\) is one such model, the set of all such models, being non-empty, must have a \(\sqsubseteq\)-minimal member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is general, and it shows that there are many different ways to construct nonmonotonic but truth preserving consequence relations. Priest was mistaken to identify nonmonotonicity with failure to preserve truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&amp;star;&amp;nbsp;&amp;star;&amp;nbsp;&amp;star;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That demonstrates the scope of the mistake. It is another thing to diagnose it. Why might you think that there is a connection between nonmonotonicity and the failure to preserve truth? Consider Priest&amp;rsquo;s motivating examples of nonmonotonic inferences: &amp;lsquo;The sun has risen every day so far. So the sun will rise tomorrow&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Tweety is a bird. So Tweety flies.&amp;rsquo; If you take those inference steps to be unrestrictedly valid in the target sense of validity, then we surely have counterexamples to truth preservation. &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; nonmonotonic consequence relations are not truth preserving. Which ones fail to be truth preserving? Is there a deeper connection between nonmonotonicity and failure to preserve truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one possible connection. Suppose the consequence relation \(\vDash^* \) satisfies the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\vDash^* \) invalid arguments are witnessed by models. If \(\Sigma\not\vDash^* A\) then there is some \(m\) where each statement in \(\Sigma\) holds in \(m\) but \(A\) does not hold in \(m\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The models \(m\) used in (1) are all &lt;em&gt;possibilities&lt;/em&gt;. If \(m\) is a model, and \(A\) is true in \(m\) then \(A\) is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(\vDash^*\)-validity is not world-relative. If an argument is valid, then had things been otherwise, it still would have been valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these three conditions, any failure of monotonicity gives rise to a failure of truth preservation. (These are sufficient conditions, not necessary conditions. There are many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; conditions under which nonmonotonic logics may fail to preserve truth.) Take a failure of monotonicity, where \(\Sigma\vDash^* C\) but \(\Sigma,B\not\vDash^* C\). By (1) there is some model \(m\) which is a counterexample to the argument from \(\Sigma,B\) to \(C\).  If the world is like \(m\), then the argument from \(\Sigma\) to \(C\), though valid according to \(\vDash^*\), would not be truth preserving, since though each member of \(\Sigma\) is true at \(m\), the conclusion \(C\) is not. By (2), this is a &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; failure of truth preservation of the argument from \(\Sigma\) to \(C\) (since what is true at \(m\) is indeed possible), and by (3), what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; valid (the argument from \(\Sigma\) to \(C\)) still would have been valid at that circumstance, so this is indeed a circumstance where a valid argument has a counterexample—it is a failure of truth preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three conditions are plausible constraints on certain kinds of consequence relations, and I conjecture that Priest endorses all three (for an appropriate way of understanding the class of models in question). If so, this explains why Priest would be reasonable to make the step from nonmonotonicity to failure to preserve truth, despite the counterexamples we have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this argument not work for the examples of truth preserving nonmonotonic logics given in the previous section? For the non-dialethic paraconsistentist, (2) fails. Inconsistent models are not all &lt;em&gt;possibilities&lt;/em&gt;. The non-dialethic paraconsistentist agrees that there is a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; in which a contradiction \(p\land\neg p\) is true while an arbitrary \(q\) is not (which is a witness to the failure of the argument from \(p\land \neg p\) to \(q\)), but such a model is a way that things cannot be, not a way that things can.  For counterfactual consequence, the worlds are each possibilities, but (3) fails. Consequence is contingent and world-relative. This argument breaks down because although a world might be a counterexample to the argument from \(\Sigma,B\) to \(C\), it doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow that if the world was like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, then we would have a counterexample to the valid argument \(\Sigma\) to \(C\), because from the point of view of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; world, the argument from \(\Sigma\) to \(C\) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathit{Cf}\)-valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, nonmonotonic consequence relations are closely connected with failures of truth preservation, but that connection is not identity. Understanding that connection an important aspect of understanding the connections between consequence relations, possibility and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In between wrapping up &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL20030/&#34;&gt;teaching for the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL40013/&#34;&gt;end of Semester 2&lt;/a&gt;, and getting ready for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/events/event?id=917&#34;&gt;short trip to Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m spending some time &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/generality-and-existence-1-arche/&#34;&gt;thinking about free logic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/generality-and-existence-2-arche/&#34;&gt;quantified modal logic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/generality-and-existence-3-arche/&#34;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;. This is difficult but exciting terrain to cover.  There is no obvious way to tie together the logic of quantifiers, the modalities and identity in a way that commands broad appeal&amp;mdash;there is no default quantified modal logic that has the same &amp;lsquo;market reach&amp;rsquo; as classical first order logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a shame, because many important arguments involve quantification, identity and possibility and necessity&amp;mdash;and claims about existence and nonexistence. Understanding the &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; of these arguments better would help us gain some kind of systematic understanding of the positions in play. In the absence of a clear picture of the logic implicit in our concepts, we&amp;rsquo;re playing the dialectical game in ignorance of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can engage in a practice without an explicit understanding of the rules of that practice. (For many kinds of practice, that is the only way to start. Think of learning your first language.) Nonetheless, making the practice explicit, and reflecting on the rules of that practice gives the participant a kind of skill that she might not have had before&amp;mdash;an ability to comprehend the possibilities, and the boundary between what is allowed and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thoughts came to mind when I read Alexander Pruss&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on free logic and modal logic in his blog post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://alexanderpruss.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/existential-commitments-of-first-order.html&#34;&gt;Existential commitments of first order Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. There he considers the fact that names in first order logic are existentially committing, and which seems undesirable, since objects so named need not exist &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt;. He comes to terms with this tension by concluding that languages involve presuppositions, and there is no issue in granting a language with contingent presuppositions&amp;mdash;including classical first order logic when the names are applied to contingently existing things.  He concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We could search for a logic without presuppositions. That&amp;rsquo;s a worthwhile quest, and leads to exploring various free logics. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go overboard in worrying about the metaphysical consequences if we don&amp;rsquo;t find a good one. Likewise, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry too much if we can&amp;rsquo;t find a satisfactory quantified modal logic. These are just tools. Nice to have, but people have done just fine with modal and other arguments for centuries without much of a formal logic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alexander Pruss on &lt;a href=&#34;http://alexanderpruss.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/existential-commitments-of-first-order.html&#34;&gt;Existential commitments of First Order Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sensible conclusion. There is nothing wrong, &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, in reasoning about possibility and necessity and existence and nonexistence and identity, etc., without a clear picture of consequences of the claims you are making. Insofar as you have a clear understanding of what follows from what is said, you have a logic.  Insofar as you don&amp;rsquo;t have a logic, you don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear understanding of what positions are consistent and which are not. Speaking a language with significant contingent presuppositions is not invariably a problem&amp;mdash;but when you&amp;rsquo;re engaged in an argument about those very presuppositions, there comes a time when you have to get as clear about them as you can. That&amp;rsquo;s when you find yourself doing some logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy task, but it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m spending some time on over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; since 2002, and the &lt;em&gt;Logic Group&lt;/em&gt; has been meeting regularly since my arrival there. While it&amp;rsquo;s changed significantly in its &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/people/&#34;&gt;membership over the last 13 years&lt;/a&gt;, one thing has remained constant—we&amp;rsquo;ve been an informal, friendly bunch of people, so hard at work in teaching and research that we&amp;rsquo;ve not had time to make a website for the group. Well, thanks to the hardworking &lt;a href=&#34;http://standefer.net&#34;&gt;Shawn Standefer&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s changed. Point your browsers to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/&#34;&gt;http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with &lt;em&gt;Logic at Melbourne&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cian Dorr on Defining Quantifiers (Verbal Disputes Workshop Report #2)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/verbal-disputes-in-oxford-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something very attractive in the idea that meanings of logical concepts—such as conjunction, negation, the quantifiers—can be specified by the role they play in proofs. If I learn the rules for conjunction:
\(
\def\sem#1{[\![#1]\!]}
\)
\[
\frac{A\land B}{A}
\quad
\frac{A\land B}{B}
\qquad
\frac{A\quad B}{A\land B}
\]
then I&amp;rsquo;ve “pinned down” what there is to know about the conjunction connective “\(\land\)”. The quantifiers are an interesting case. The rules for quantifiers, like \((\exists x)\) prove to be more complex.
\[
\frac{A(t)}{(\exists x)A(x)}
\qquad
\frac{
{{{}\atop{\large }}\atop{\large (\exists x)A(x)}}
\quad
{{{\LARGE A(n)}\atop{\large \vdots}}\atop{\large C}}
}
{C}
\]
(where in the second rule, the name \(n\) is not present in \(C\) or in the other premises of the subproof from \(A(n)\) to \(C\)). In these rules, we unwrap the quantified expression \((\exists x)A(x)\) into a simpler expression which is an &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt; of the schema \(A(x)\). In the introduction rule, \(A(t)\) is an instance formed by substituting any singular term \(t\) for \(x\), while in the elimination rule, it must be a &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; (or an eigenvariable). The details can be worked out in many different ways, but one feature remains the same: the semantics of quantifiers is tied closely to the semantics of singular terms. Can we avoid this connection? Is there a way to define the semantics of quantifiers in by way of their rules in proof which do not tie them so closely to the semantics of singular terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the goals of &lt;a href=&#34;https://files.nyu.edu/cd50/public/&#34;&gt;Cian Dorr&lt;/a&gt;’s talk “Pinning Down the Meanings of Quantifiers” at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://verbaldisputesoxford.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Verbal Disputes&lt;/a&gt; conference, and is a central theme in his paper “&lt;a href=&#34;http://philpapers.org/rec/DORQVA&#34;&gt;Quantifier Variance and the Collapse Theorems&lt;/a&gt;”. There’s a lot in the paper (it&amp;rsquo;s 67 pages long!), and I won’t engage with most of it, but I’d like to discuss this central theme of the paper here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/mvd-cian.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Cian Dorr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Cian Dorr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial insight is that we can think of the quantifier proof rules not as relating propositions or sentences or judgements, but as relating &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt;. The step from \(Fx\) to \((\exists x)Fx\) need not lead from a particular judgement that a given thing \(x\) is \(F\), but rather, from the concept &lt;em&gt;being \(F\)&lt;/em&gt;. The step from ‘\(x\) is green’ to ‘\(x\) is coloured’ corresponds to a relationship between the concepts of being green and being coloured. The relationship of entailment between propositions is filled out to include entailment &lt;em&gt;between concepts&lt;/em&gt;, and between concepts of higher arities—for binary, ternary, relations, etc., and between concepts and propositions, which can be understood as zero-place concepts. The crucial point is that this relationship of concept entailment is not to be reduced to propositional entailment. We are not to define ‘\(c\) entails \(d\)’ as ‘Necessarily, everything that falls under \(c\) falls under \(d\)’ because this would be to put the cart before the horse. Instead of defining concept entailment in terms of quantifiers and propositional entailment, the goal is to define quantifiers in terms of concept entailment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are we to understand concept entailment? Cian gives an interesting discussion of the connection between concept entailment and concept &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; (offering analyses like this: \(c\) entails \(d\) if and only if to fall under \(c\) is to fall under \(c\) and to fall under \(d\)). The details of any such definition need not concern us now, suffice to note that all such analyses offered in the paper “Quantifier Variance and the Collapse Theorems” feature conjunction and some kind of concept identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some useful and clear thinking on how one is to identify and distinguish higher arity concepts&amp;mdash;explaining the sense in which semantic values of predicates is related to the variables used in the presentation of those predicates:  \({}^{\langle x,y\rangle}\sem{x\textrm{ loves }y} = {}^{\langle y,x\rangle}\sem{y\textrm{ loves }x}\), which is the concept &lt;em&gt;loving&lt;/em&gt;, while  \({}^{\langle x,y\rangle}\sem{y\textrm{ loves }x}\) is the concept &lt;em&gt;being loved by&lt;/em&gt;, and specifying a sensible constraint on concept entailment, that it is indifferent to the choice of sequence of variables used to present the entailment&amp;mdash;we get to the point where we can specify a reading of the quantifier rules free of singular terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(\exists v\) is an existential quantifier if and only if (for all sequences \(\sigma\) of variables including all free variables in \(A\) and \(B\), and where the variable \(v\) is not free in \(B\)) (1) \({}^\sigma\sem{A}\) entails \({}^\sigma\sem{(\exists v)A}\) (that&amp;rsquo;s the introduction rule), and (2) if \({}^\sigma\sem{A}\) entails \({}^\sigma\sem{B}\) then \({}^\sigma\sem{A}\) entails \({}^\sigma\sem{(\exists v)B}\) (that&amp;rsquo;s the elimination rule).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is beautiful and elegant. The logic of concept identity and entailment determines the logic of the quantifiers. I say the quantifier&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; because what holds for the existential quantifier holds for the universal quantifier, too. In fact, Cian points out that the quantifier rules are exceedingly natural as the left and right adjoints of the &lt;em&gt;concept expansion&lt;/em&gt; function. (What is concept expansion? The expansion of a concept is the variant which adds a redundant argument place. The expansion of the concept &lt;em&gt;being red&lt;/em&gt; (or \({}^{\langle x\rangle}\sem{x\textrm{ is red}}\)) is the two-place concept \({}^{\langle x,y\rangle}\sem{x\textrm{ is red}}\) which says of two things that the first is red.) Adjoints (or Galois connections, residuals, display equivalences, wrapping and unwrapping) are wonderful things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is beautiful, but the &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; is not surprising or news to those who are familiar with proof theory or categories and logic. The central concepts are present, for example, in Lambek and Scott’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openisbn.com/isbn/0521356539/&#34;&gt;Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, though Cian explains them differently. What is new here is the philosophical setting and the applications. In the talk in Oxford, Cian explained the consequences of this view of the quantifiers for discussions of &lt;em&gt;necessitism&lt;/em&gt; and quantifier variance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the concept “not being identical to anything” understood as
\({}^{\langle x\rangle}\sem{\neg (\exists y)x=y}\) (there is no \(y\) to which \(x\) are identical). If objects exist contingently, it seems that the application of this concept to some contingently existing object (say, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;) is contingently false. On this picture, I am identical to something, but had I not existed, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been identical to something. On the other hand, even for the contingentist, the proposition \(\sem{(\exists x)\neg (\exists y)x=y}\) is &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; false. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible that there be an object which is not identical to any object, because&amp;mdash;of necessity&amp;mdash;all objects are self-identical. If the contingentist has granted both of those points, it’s relatively straightforward to show that the contingentist’s existential quantifier is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the adjoint of expansion. In particular, it does not satisfy the elimination rule, because \({}^{\langle x\rangle}\sem{\neg (\exists y)x=y}\) does not entail \(\sem{(\exists x)\neg (\exists y)x=y}\), since nothing contingently false  entails anything necessarily false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good, and Cian uses these results to put pressure on the contingentist and the quantifier variantist, and to lend support for necessitism. (I want to be careful not to misconstrue Cian&amp;rsquo;s position—at the workshop, at least, he was not &lt;em&gt;committed&lt;/em&gt; to necessitism. He was exploring these arguments and seeing where they lead.) I think that the situation here is complex, and interesting, and worth exploring. In particular, I think that there&amp;rsquo;s no direct route from concept entailment (and the definition of the quantifiers as adjoints) to necessitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key issue centres around the behaviour of concept entailment, and its definition of concept identity. For the analysis to work, concept identity is not to be identified with identity of &lt;em&gt;extension&lt;/em&gt;. Even if all every object that happens to be a renate also happens to be a chordate, and &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow that &lt;em&gt;being a renate&lt;/em&gt; is the same concept as &lt;em&gt;being a chordate&lt;/em&gt;. If we collapse concept identity into identity of extension, there is no pressure towards necessitism. On the other hand, we cannot have a too-fine notion of concept identity which distinguishes logically equivalent sentences (or logically equivalent predicates). &lt;em&gt;Being a renate and chordate&lt;/em&gt; should be the same concept as &lt;em&gt;being a chordate and a renate&lt;/em&gt;, and the same concept as &lt;em&gt;being a chordate and either a renate or a non-chordate&lt;/em&gt; (at least given the standard classical equivalence of \(Fx\land Gx\) with \(Fx\land(Gx\lor\neg Fx)\), which is not in question here).  Our concept identity is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; intensional that it distinguishes logically equivalent statements or predicates. But requiring that logically equivalent statements determine the one concept still leaves much room for open questions concerning concept identity. Consider two names, \(a\) and \(b\), where it&amp;rsquo;s an open question concerning whether they are identical or not. Then, it seems that the concepts
\[
{}^{\langle x\rangle}\sem{(x=a)\land(x\neq b)}
\quad
{}^{\langle x\rangle}\sem{(x=a)\land(x=b)}
\]
are non-trivial, since neither of them are logically equivalent to the inconsistent concept \({}^{\langle x\rangle}\sem{\bot}\), and it&amp;rsquo;s an open question as to which one of them is satisfied by the object \(a\). If \(a\) and \(b\) are rigid designators, then on the orthodox Kripkean line, one of these concepts is necessarily false, but they need not be &lt;em&gt;analytically&lt;/em&gt; false or &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; to be false. If we allow for concept identity to be more finely grained than simple agreement of extension in all possible worlds, and if we allow for modalities stronger than necessity (say, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml&#34;&gt;analyticity, or a priori knowability&lt;/a&gt;) then it seems that Cian&amp;rsquo;s argument applies equally well to them, too. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to be a &lt;em&gt;necessitist&lt;/em&gt; about objects, and think that the same objects exist in all possible worlds. Do we also want to also take the objects to persist across all epistemic scenarios, whether possible or impossible?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adventures in Bi-Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/adventures-in-bi-intuitionistic-logic/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2015 04:04:25 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/adventures-in-bi-intuitionistic-logic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org/event/show/17572&#34;&gt;Logic Seminar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.latrobe.edu.au/psy/about/staff/profile?uname=TKowalski&#34;&gt;Tomasz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://tomasz-kowalski.ltumathstats.com&#34;&gt;Kowalski&lt;/a&gt; introduced some lovely results about analytic cut and interpolation in sequent systems for bi-intuitionistic logic. After the seminar, Lloyd Humberstone, Dave Ripley, Tomasz and I got talking about various features of bi-intuitionistic logic, some of which should be more well known than they are &amp;hellip; so I may as well post them here. Read on, if you&amp;rsquo;re into non-classical logic, algebras and frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditional in intuitionistic logic satisfies the lovely residuation principle:
\[
p\land q \le r
\quad
\Leftrightarrow
\quad
p\land q\supset r
\]
where \(\le\) is entailment&amp;mdash;the underlying lattice ordering on propositions&amp;ndash;and \(\land\) is conjunction.  Bi-intuitionistic logic is found by adding to the vocabulary a  two-place connective (&lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt; to the conditional) of &lt;em&gt;subtraction&lt;/em&gt;, satisfying the dual residuation principle:
\[
p\le q\lor r
\quad
\Leftrightarrow
\quad
p-q \le r
\]
This has lots of lovely (and strange) properties. If \(p\supset 0\) defines the strong intuitionist negation (which is a contrary but not sub-contrary forming operator) then \(1-p\) forms a weak dual negation (which is a sub-contrary but not contrary forming operator). It is a conservative addition to the &lt;em&gt;propositional&lt;/em&gt; inuitionist logic. (All complete and completely distributive lattices can be equipped with a subtraction operator, defined by setting \(p-q\) to be \(\bigwedge\{r:p\le q\lor r\}\), and all Heyting lattices can be embedded into complete and completly distributive Heyting lattices.) It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a conservative extension of first-order intuitionist logic. (With subtraction, you can show that \(\forall x(Fx\lor Gx)\) entails \(\forall x Fx\lor \exists xGx\), which is underivable in intuitionist logic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result I thought should be more well known is that the dual intuitionist substraction can be &lt;em&gt;defined&lt;/em&gt; if you add a de Morgan negation to intiutionst logic, and this addition is also conservative in the propositional case. A de Morgan negation is an operator \(\sim\) such that \({\mathord\sim}{\mathord\sim}p=p\) and \(p\le q\) only if \({\mathord\sim}q\le {\mathord\sim}p\). It&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;de Morgan negation&amp;rdquo; because in a &lt;em&gt;lattice&lt;/em&gt;, these conditions mean that all four de Morgan laws hold connecting \({\mathord\sim}\), \(\land\) and \(\lor\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lemma 9.35 in my substructural logic book (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/isl&#34;&gt;An Introduction to Substructural Logics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) is a construction that embeds a lattice into one including a de Morgan negation. (This construction&amp;mdash;like many results in this field&amp;mdash;uses techniques due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093890896&#34;&gt;Bob Meyer&lt;/a&gt;.) The construction is straightforward. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; work in the Heyting lattice case, but it&amp;rsquo;s very close to working. That construction takes the original lattice, adds a top element (if not already present) and adds an inverted copy of the structure below the original structure. This construction doesn&amp;rsquo;t preserve the bottom element (that&amp;rsquo;s no good, as we can express this in intuitionistic logic, with \(p\land\neg p\)), and it&amp;rsquo;s fiddly to see how you might do that using algebraic surgery. Perhaps you can, but I worry about getting the cases correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it suggest a way to do it relatively straightforwardly, using Kripke frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s well known that in frame semantics, a de Morgan negation can be modelled using a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;Routley star&lt;/a&gt; operation. A unary function on points in the frame such that \(x^{&amp;ast;&amp;ast;}=x\) and if \(x\sqsubseteq y\) then \(y^{&amp;ast;}\sqsubseteq x^{&amp;ast;}\). Then we define
\[
x\Vdash {\mathord\sim}A
\quad
\Leftrightarrow
x^{&amp;ast;}\not\Vdash A
\]
and the result is a de Morgan negation. That&amp;rsquo;s fair enough. But there&amp;rsquo;s no way, in general, to take a Kripke frame for intuitionistic logic and slap a de Morgan negation onto it. Take the three-point tree on the set \(\{a,b,c\}\) where \(a\sqsubset b\) and \(a\sqsubset c\). There aren&amp;rsquo;t enough candidates for \(b^{&amp;ast;}\) and \(c^{&amp;ast;}\). They need to be &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; and they need to be &lt;em&gt;earlier&lt;/em&gt; than \(a^{&amp;ast;}\) in the ordering, but there&amp;rsquo;s not enough objects in the frame to satisfy this. To do this, we need three objects \(\{e,f,g\}\)&amp;mdash;somewhere&amp;ndash;where \(f\sqsubset e\) and \(g\sqsubset e\), so we can let \(a^{&amp;ast;}=e\), \(b^{&amp;ast;}=f\) and  \(c^{&amp;ast;}=g\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to do this to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Kripke model \(\langle P,\sqsubseteq,\vDash\rangle\) is to add a new set \(P^{&amp;ast;}\)&amp;mdash;an extra copy of \(P\), so we operate on the disjoint union \(P\cup P^{&amp;ast;}\).  We define the operation \({&amp;ast;}\) in the obvious way: if \(x\) is in \(P\), then its star is the copy \(x^{&amp;ast;}\) in \(P^{&amp;ast;}\). Define the ordering by allowing \(x^{&amp;ast;}\sqsubseteq y\) but not \(y \sqsubseteq x^{&amp;ast;}\) for each \(x,y\) in \(P\) (so each of the \(P^{&amp;ast;}\) points come &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the \(P\) points) and setting \(x^{&amp;ast;} \sqsubseteq y^{&amp;ast;}\) iff \(y \sqsubseteq x\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In other words, we take a copy of our Kripke frame, &lt;em&gt;invert&lt;/em&gt; it, and have all of those points come &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; each of the original points.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation &amp;ast; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/negrl/&#34;&gt;Routley star&lt;/a&gt; on the structure, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a poset, so we have a Kripke frame. We can use &amp;ast; on the frame to define a de Morgan negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the original model \(\langle P,\sqsubseteq,\Vdash\rangle\), extend the valuation to the new domain \(P \cup P^{&amp;ast;}\) as required by heredity on frames. Any atom true at some point in \(P\) is true at all points in \(P^{&amp;ast;}\), but any atom not true anywhere in \(P\) can remain not true everywhere in \(P^{&amp;ast;}\). An easy induction shows that if formula is true at a point in \(P\) in the original model iff it’s true at that point in the extended model. (The extension \([\![p]\!]\) of an atom in the new model is now closed upward under \(\sqsubseteq\), and \([\![p]\!]\cap P\) remains the same as the extension of \(p\) in the old model. Furthermore, since all evaluation conditions for intuitionist connectives &lt;em&gt;look forward&lt;/em&gt;, the restriction of \([\![A]\!]\) (for any complex formula \(A\)) to \(P\) is identical to the extension of  \([\![A]\!]\) in the old model, by an induction on the construction of \(A\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This construction shows how to embed the new propositions between the bottom element and anything else in the original Heyting algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt; construction could add the elements in the Kripke frame &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the original elements (and then everything gets embedded just below the top element), or they could be &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theincomparable.com&#34;&gt;incomparable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with the objects in original frame. But as Lloyd Humberstone pointed out to me, the dual construction is not conservative, because the evaluation of formulas on the original set \(P\) now looks &lt;em&gt;forward&lt;/em&gt; to more points, those in \(P^{&amp;ast;}\), and this can change the truth of intuitionist formulas. For example, given a model consisting two points \(a,b\) which are incomparable through \(\sqsubseteq\), where we set \(a\Vdash p\) but \(b\not\Vdash p\), then if we add \(a^{&amp;ast;}\) and \(b^{&amp;ast;}\) to both occur &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; both \(a\) and \(b\) then we are in a quandry. Since \(p\) is true at \(a\), and since \(a\sqsubseteq a^{&amp;ast;}\) we must have \(a^{&amp;ast;}\Vdash p\). But then it follows that in the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; model, \(b\not\Vdash \neg p\), despite the fact that in the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; model, \(b\Vdash\neg p\). The addition does not preserve the logical structure of propositions on the original frame, so it cannot be used to demonstrate conservative extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the construction where the new points are placed &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the original points, or where they are &lt;em&gt;alongside&lt;/em&gt; (and incomparable) have no such problems.
So there are at least 2 different ways to take a Kripke model for intuitionistic logic and to embed it into a structure supporting a de Morgan negation, and thus allowing the de Morgan laws to interdefine the intuitionistic conditional and dual intuitionistic subtraction. This shows that intuitionistic propositional logic is conservatively extended by a de Morgan negation, and this de Morgan negation can be used to define the weird binary connective of subtraction&amp;mdash;all without doing damage to the underlying propositional logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Tomasz, for a fun &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org/event/show/17572&#34;&gt;logic seminar&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and for reminding me of these results. After spending over seven years concentrating on proof theory, it feels comfortable to slip back into working with algebras and frames.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Verbal Disputes in Oxford (Workshop Report #1)</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/verbal-disputes-in-oxford/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back from last week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/quick-trip-to-oxford/&#34;&gt;quick trip to Oxford for a workshop on Verbal Disputes&lt;/a&gt;, just in time to wrap up the last week of teaching in my two &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/class/2015/UNIB10002&#34;&gt;undergraduate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL30043&#34;&gt;units&lt;/a&gt; as the semester winds up here in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://verbaldisputesoxford.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; was an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; two-day workshop, capably organised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ertegun.ox.ac.uk/staff-scholars/trevor-teitel&#34;&gt;Trevor Teitel&lt;/a&gt;, and funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ertegun.ox.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;Ertegun Graduate Scholarship Programme for the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;. There was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to think about in the papers presented at the conference, and the informal discussions between talks.  In another entry, I&amp;rsquo;ll comment on &lt;a href=&#34;https://files.nyu.edu/cd50/public/&#34;&gt;Cian Dorr&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talk &amp;ldquo;Pinning Down the Meanings of Quantifiers.&amp;rdquo; In this entry I&amp;rsquo;ll make some general remarks about the workshop and, in particular, about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amiethomasson.org/&#34;&gt;Amie Thomasson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talk &amp;ldquo;Metaphysical Disputes and Metalinguistic Negotiation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A highlight of a workshop like this is &lt;em&gt;meeting&lt;/em&gt; people, maintaining contact with those you&amp;rsquo;ve met before, and making new connections with new friends and colleagues. While there were lots of different views expressed at the conference, there was enough common ground&amp;mdash;and more than enough good will and good humour&amp;mdash;to have fruitful and productive conversations. This was a great workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop as a whole had seven presentations. The first day kicked off with a talk by &lt;a href=&#34;http://robert-williams.org&#34;&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt;, on representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.umass.edu/mayae/&#34;&gt;Maya Eddon&lt;/a&gt;, on whether the parthood relation was perfectly natural or not. This was filled with elegant examples of cases where parthood fails to supervene on natural properties&amp;mdash;unless parthood (or something like it) is admitted to the supervenience base.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Maya Eddon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day wrapped up with a talk from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/members/philosophy_panel/tim_williamson&#34;&gt;Tim Williamson&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;graceful degradation&lt;/em&gt; and disputes over meanings of terms. For Williamson, we degrade our language if we avoid a disputed term, using in its place other terms already in the vocabulary. It&amp;rsquo;s a Good Thing if we can do this without catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case, the talks were clear, interesting, and not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; focussed on verbal disputes as such, but on issues in metaphysics and philosophy of language in and around that debate. I was reasonably jetlagged for the first day of the workshop (having landed in the UK the previous afternoon), so I don&amp;rsquo;t have many precise or detailed comments to make about those talks. Regardless, they were an enjoyable way to ease into the conference and to think about the themes under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day two started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/presentation/2015/verbal-disputes-oxford/&#34;&gt;my talk&lt;/a&gt; (which included an obligatory Led Zeppelin reference, in honour of Ahmet Ertegun&amp;rsquo;s connection with the band, having signed them to Atlantic Records). This effort was &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; upstaged by Dave Chalmers in his talk, which was a recapitulation of the issues in his long and influential paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf&#34;&gt;Verbal Disputes&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dave&amp;rsquo;s presentation, I now understand how it is that Led Zeppelin embrace &lt;em&gt;semantic externalism&lt;/em&gt; and the possibility of &lt;em&gt;radical skepticism&lt;/em&gt; in such insightful lines as &amp;ldquo;sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.&amp;rdquo; Thanks, Dave. I&amp;rsquo;ll never listen to &amp;lsquo;Stairway to Heaven&amp;rsquo; in quite the same way, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlights for me in the workshop, though, were the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; two talks on the second day. &lt;a href=&#34;https://files.nyu.edu/cd50/public/&#34;&gt;Cian Dorr&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talk on the &lt;em&gt;semantics of quantifiers&lt;/em&gt; (which I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss in another post) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amiethomasson.org&#34;&gt;Amie Thomasson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s, on &lt;em&gt;metalinguistic negotiation&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ll write about Cian&amp;rsquo;s work on quantifiers in another entry. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on Amie&amp;rsquo;s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/mvd-amie.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Amie Thomasson&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Amie Thomasson&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amie&amp;rsquo;s talk posed a problem for two views: &lt;em&gt;her own&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199385119.do&#34;&gt;easy ontology&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; and Eli Hirsch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-2237.2002.tb00061.x/abstract&#34;&gt;quantifier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iPRqtcjeHPsC&#34;&gt;variance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. According to &lt;em&gt;Easy Ontology&lt;/em&gt; a metaphysical question like &amp;ldquo;there are numbers&amp;rdquo; is decided by the meanings of mathematical terms involved in the expressions, and nothing more than that. On a &lt;em&gt;Quantifier Variance&lt;/em&gt; picture, a debate between a nominalist and a platonist about whether there &lt;em&gt;really are&lt;/em&gt; numbers is resolved when you recognise that the proponents of the different metaphyiscal views are using quantifiers in different ways, and a charitable interpretation of both speakers would have them speaking past one another. When a platonist says there are numbers, and a nominalist denies it, they are speaking different languages, roughly speaking, at least. For Amie, both views are faced with a &lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt;: they seem to make certain sorts of debate all too &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://brokopp.casinocitytimes.com/article/are-race-horses-athletes-you-bet-they-are-19697&#34;&gt;debate over whether a horse could count as an athlete&lt;/a&gt; is not the kind of thing that can be solved by a simple disambiguation, or by inspecting the clear and distinct semantics of the term &amp;ldquo;athlete&amp;rdquo; to see what is allowed and what is forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine wading into the debate and saying this: &amp;ldquo;There are two things one could mean by &amp;lsquo;athlete,&amp;rsquo; one of which includes horses and the other of which is restricted to sentient and sapient creatures. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_(horse) is clearly an *athlete*&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and clearly not an *athlete*&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, and that&#39;s all there is to say.&amp;quot; While this might helpfully clarify the discussion, it wouldn&#39;t stop the debate. What *everyone* wants to know is whether *athlete*&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; or *athlete*&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; (or any other precisification of the concept&#34;&gt;Secretariat&lt;/a&gt; is what we mean&amp;mdash;or what we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; mean&amp;mdash;by &amp;ldquo;athlete.&amp;rdquo; After all, we might be deciding on whether a horse could be in the running for &lt;a href=&#34;http://brokopp.casinocitytimes.com/article/are-race-horses-athletes-you-bet-they-are-19697&#34;&gt;Athlete of the Year&lt;/a&gt; or not. The award was established as &amp;ldquo;Athlete of the Year,&amp;rdquo; not as &amp;ldquo;Athlete&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the Year&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Athlete&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the Year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, take a more significant debate. We can argue as to whether a particular act counts as &lt;em&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/em&gt;. It may clarify things to say that in one sense it counts as sexual harassment and in another sense it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. However, such a disambiguation doesn&amp;rsquo;t end discussion, because the term &amp;ldquo;sexual harassment&amp;rdquo; is used in many different contexts, and&amp;mdash;in effect&amp;mdash;replacing that term by two different terms &amp;ldquo;sexual harassment&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sexual harassment&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;multiplies&lt;/em&gt; all of our problems, because now we need to go back to look at all of the other ways we used the term, to see how this new distinction bears on &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; discussions. That&amp;rsquo;s a significant part of the debate, and it&amp;rsquo;s nothing like a free and arbitrary choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amie characterised this sort of debate as a kind of &lt;em&gt;metalinguistic negotiation&lt;/em&gt;, using the terminology introduced by David Plunkett and Timothy Sundell in their paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3521354.0013.023&#34;&gt;Disagreement and the Semantics of Normative and Evaluative Terms&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Philosophers&amp;rsquo; Imprint&lt;/em&gt;, 13 (2013) (see page 6). The core idea is that these sorts of debates are ways to settle &lt;em&gt;how a term ought to be used&lt;/em&gt; by way of a first order debate about matters &lt;em&gt;involving&lt;/em&gt; that term. Given that we want to continue to use the one term (&amp;ldquo;athlete&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sexual harassment&amp;rdquo;, etc.) trying to come to some kind of agreement over whether this horse counts as an athlete or that act counts as sexual harassment is a way to come to grips with how to use the vocabulary from now on. Or so the account goes.  The result is that neither an easy ontology view nor a quantifier variance view is committed to the claim that what might be thought of as a verbal dispute (over whether there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; numbers or not) is at all &lt;em&gt;straightforward&lt;/em&gt;, because it&amp;rsquo;s actually a debate over how are are to go on to use our vocabulary, and that vocabulary is a complex network of connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But I&amp;rsquo;m curious about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; such a metalinguistic negotiation might work, and one other event in Oxford, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/podcasts/john_locke_lectures&#34;&gt;Rae Langton&amp;rsquo;s Locke Lectures&lt;/a&gt; gives me an idea. Here is a conjecture. The process of semantic coordination involved in a debate over a contested term proceeds by way of &lt;em&gt;accommodation&lt;/em&gt;. In particular, if one party in a debate offers an &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; for a conclusion (she&amp;rsquo;s an athlete, because &amp;hellip;; that&amp;rsquo;s harassment, since &amp;hellip;), then in the conversational context, the premises are being offered as a reason for the conclusion. When I assert: &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;, since &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m not only asserting &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; and asserting &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;m presenting &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; as a reason for &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;. The explicit context of what I&amp;rsquo;ve asserted is &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also implicitly made the conditional claim &amp;ldquo;if &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; is a reason for &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t object, we accommodate for this in the common ground of the discussion&amp;mdash;we grant that this is an acceptable transition. If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; object to my claim, you could either object to the explicit content of what I&amp;rsquo;ve said (you could disagree with &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; or with &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;), or you could take issue with the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we have a debate over the disputed vocabulary, we often find ourselves with a whole pile of reasons out on the table. Some are granted and others are contested. At the end of the process, we may not find agreement, but the aim is to sort out what connections involving our concepts and our claims are to be endorsed and what are to be rejected. As to why this might be an appropriate way to conduct a debate over disputed conecept, there&amp;rsquo;s much more to be said. But I think that this is a fruitful start, and it&amp;rsquo;s a connection I hope to explore more.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

    &lt;figcaption&gt;I&#39;m here for May 20 and 21&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I head off on a &lt;em&gt;flying visit&lt;/em&gt; to Oxford for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://verbaldisputesoxford.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Workshop on Verbal Disputes and their Philosophical Significance&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to catching up with old friends and making new ones. The lineup for the workshop is fantastic, so it looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll be a great time. If you&amp;rsquo;re in the area, please do come along and say &amp;ldquo;hi&amp;rdquo;. If you can&amp;rsquo;t come, I&amp;rsquo;ve posted the slides and handout for my talk &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/verbal-disputes-oxford/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m away from Melbourne from late May 18, and I return on May 24. Six nights away, two nights in planes and four in the UK. It&amp;rsquo;s a ridiculously short trip, given that I&amp;rsquo;m flying halfway across the world. But I teach classes on Mondays and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to cancel any of those so near to the end of the semester, so this time it will be a very quick trip.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Advocacy on Sydney Road</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/advocacy-on-sydney-road/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2015 12:49:30 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/advocacy-on-sydney-road/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of Sunday March 1, Sydney Road in Brunswick was transformed by its annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brunswickmusicfestival.com.au/sydney-road-street-party.htm&#34;&gt;Street Party&lt;/a&gt;. Over four blocks of this busy inner north thoroughfare was closed to trams and cars, lined by stalls, punctuated with live bands, and filled with crowds. Everyone was sampling wares, eating, drinking and soaking in the atmosphere. It&amp;rsquo;s a distinctive slice of multicultural Brunswick life, and an opportunity for everyone to get out and sample that Brunswick experience in all its variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of us from the Melbourne Inner North &lt;a href=&#34;http://tear.org.au&#34;&gt;TEAR&lt;/a&gt; Group were there, between a Scout Group sausage sizzle on the one side and the Animal Protection Society, with its vegan cookbooks and petitions on the other. We ran a little stall lined with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tear.org.au/learn/target/&#34;&gt;TEAR Targets&lt;/a&gt;, information about Australian Aid and its positive impact on poverty and development in our region, and postcards to send to the Foreign Minister, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.juliebishop.com.au&#34;&gt;Julie Bishop&lt;/a&gt;. We were encouraging our fellow residents of the Inner North to urge Julie Bishop and our government to our commitments towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals. In honour of International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day, we made flowers for passers by to attach to their postcard, and we collected nearly 50 to send along to Canberra to help the government to get the message that our community takes helping our neighbours to be an important part of our national character, and not something to be dropped when some difficult decisions need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Signed Postcards with Flowers for Julie Bishop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the afternoon we had many interesting conversations with passers by, young and old, including local politicians from the Greens and the ALP, many students, local Brunswick residents and visitors from further afield, and a couple of anarchists up from Tasmania&amp;mdash;who agreed with our aims but thought that our methods were far too conservative. All our conversations were friendly, whether passers by agreed with us or disagreed, and many were happy to see a Christian organisation like &lt;a href=&#34;http://tear.org.au&#34;&gt;TEAR&lt;/a&gt; with a presence on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, 50 signatures on petitions is not enough on its own to change a Minister&amp;rsquo;s mind—even if the flowers everyone attached were very attractive—but this was one small part of an ongoing community conversation. May that conversation continue, and may the wider community find its voice so that we all recognise what it means to be a good neighbour to those around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Just today, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/102098742&#34;&gt;a video of an interview with me from 2013&lt;/a&gt;, explaining our thinking behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/logic1_coursera/&#34;&gt;teaching introductory logic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/logic2_coursera/&#34;&gt;on Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, and the connections between this and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/UNIB10002&#34;&gt;classroom teaching&lt;/a&gt;. Come for the ideas, stay for the crazy hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Come and work with me on proof theory and philosophy</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/come-work-with-me/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2015 12:28:44 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/come-work-with-me/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; announce that I have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/885576/postdoctoral-fellow-philosophy&#34;&gt;job to offer&lt;/a&gt; on my five year ARC funded research project in philosophical logic and its applications, &amp;ldquo;Meaning in Action: new techniques for language, logic and information.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a two year postdoctoral research position, with a little bit of teaching on the side. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in philosophical logic, and would like to join the logic group at Melbourne, this is the job for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details are &lt;a href=&#34;http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/885576/postdoctoral-fellow-philosophy&#34;&gt;online at the University of Melbourne careers site&lt;/a&gt;, and if you  applying, you should read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/misc/DP150103801_app.pdf&#34;&gt;project description&lt;/a&gt; so you can address how you would contribute to the research project in your application for the job. To apply, follow the instructions &lt;a href=&#34;http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/885576/postdoctoral-fellow-philosophy&#34;&gt;on the University of Melbourne careers site&lt;/a&gt;. The closing date for the application is &lt;strong&gt;April 19, 2015&lt;/strong&gt; (That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Melbourne&lt;/em&gt; time. Don&amp;rsquo;t be bitten by thinking that midnight April 19 &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; time is still April 19 &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; time.) If you have any questions, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get back to me. And let everyone know about this position. I&amp;rsquo;ll be delighted to have a strong field of applicants. This is an exciting research project, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to working on it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Here are a few answers to questions I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no fixed starting date for the position, though if you can be on board for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/unisec/PDates/acadcale.html&#34;&gt;Semester 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s a strong plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teaching responsibilities for the position are small (at most &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the workload), and are to be decided in consultation with me&amp;mdash;this part of the role is to give the candidate some teaching experience, and to cover a little of my teaching to free me up to do some more research. Take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/class/&#34;&gt;my teaching&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get an idea of the opportunities for teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have other questions about the position, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&#34;#about&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;, and if you know some likely candidates, please point them this way.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Academic Genealogy</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/academic-genealogy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2015 00:35:19 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/academic-genealogy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have known about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php&#34;&gt;Mathematical Genealogy Project&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/06/07/ancestors/&#34;&gt;quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, but, prompted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://ucalgary.ca/rzach/blog/2015/02/academic-genealogy-graphed.html&#34;&gt;Richard Zach&lt;/a&gt; I notice two new and wonderful things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidalber.net/&#34;&gt;David Alber&lt;/a&gt; has produced in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidalber.net/geneagrapher/&#34;&gt;Geneagrapher&lt;/a&gt; a neat tool to download genealogy data and save a .dot file, which can be read by &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphviz.org&#34;&gt;Graphviz&lt;/a&gt; and displayed as a directed graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a detail from my genealogy. (This image is a link to a pdf file of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/restall-genealogy.pdf&#34;&gt;entire thing&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/restall-genealogy.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/genealogy-detail.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Greg Restall&#39;s Academic Genealogy&#34; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Some of my genealogy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second new thing is that I found to my great surprise and delight that the database has been &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; filled out since I last looked through it. My academic ancestry has been traced back to the 14th Century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/restall-genealogy.pdf&#34;&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;, you can see that there is a recent branch point at my great&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-grandparent, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=17975&#34;&gt;Richard Rado&lt;/a&gt;, who had two supervisors, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=17806&#34;&gt;G. H. Hardy&lt;/a&gt;, who was educated in Cambridge, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=9179&#34;&gt;Issai Schur&lt;/a&gt;, from Berlin. The Berlin side of my &amp;lsquo;family&amp;rsquo; has a completely continental European background, while the Cambridge side is firmly English for generations, until you go back to the 17th Century, where you find that Isaac Newton&amp;rsquo;s grandparent &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=133302&#34;&gt;Vincenzo Viviani&lt;/a&gt; was educated at the University of Pisa (and one of his Doctoral advisors was &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18231&#34;&gt;Galileo Galilei&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See if you can spot &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=125434&#34;&gt;Mersenne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18231&#34;&gt;Gauss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=74313&#34;&gt;Newton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18231&#34;&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=7486&#34;&gt;Weierstrass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=7824&#34;&gt;Cayley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=4642&#34;&gt;Frobenius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=125938&#34;&gt;Erasmus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=141571&#34;&gt;Cranmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=131539&#34;&gt;Ficino&lt;/a&gt; among my ancestors. It&amp;rsquo;s dizzying to see so much of your academic ancestry laid out for inspection, and to see how ideas have been passed down from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another striking thing about this genealogy? There are &lt;em&gt;no women there&lt;/em&gt;. None at all. (Not even among my own graduate students, each of whom I&amp;rsquo;m very proud indeed.) May this change, and change very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Richard, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://ucalgary.ca/rzach/blog/2015/02/academic-genealogy-graphed.html&#34;&gt;the prompt&lt;/a&gt;. This has been a delight to explore.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Classes in Semester One</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/semester-one-classes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2015 23:55:17 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/semester-one-classes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL30043/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/Power_and_Limits.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Power and Limits of Logic&#34; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Power and Limits of Logic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching started for first semester, with the launch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/class/2015/logic1_coursera/&#34;&gt;Logic: Language and Information 1&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera. That&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of fun already, with over 17,000 enrolled. There&amp;rsquo;s something very exciting about being involved with a large number of students all around the world, choosing to work hard to learn logic for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m most excited, though, by the next run-through of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL30043&#34;&gt;Kurt G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Hits&lt;/a&gt;, starting next week. This time, I&amp;rsquo;m teaching the class entirely in a flipped mode, with students working through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/2015/PHIL30043&#34;&gt;lecture videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;before class&lt;/em&gt; each week, and working with me on a mix of simpler peer instruction questions to establish the basic understanding of core concepts,  and going on to more complex material and independent engagement with the material. We meet weekly in a two hour seminar (from 9 to 11am each Monday&amp;mdash;what a way to start the week!). With a group of between 25 and 30 students, this will be intense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of ground to cover, from soundness and completeness Theorems, through compactness, cardinality L&amp;oslash;wenheim&amp;ndash;Skolem theorems, computability, to G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s Theorems and L&amp;ouml;b&amp;rsquo;s Theorem. It&amp;rsquo;ll be quite a ride. This material &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; available through Coursera, but I have made the videos &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/class/2015/PHIL30043&#34;&gt;available for your use&lt;/a&gt; if you wish. (I only ask that you acknowledge that you got them from here if you make them publicly available in any medium.)&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Do LNC and LEM suffice to define negation?</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/lnc-and-lem-but-not-negation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2015 23:20:25 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/lnc-and-lem-but-not-negation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; negation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One answer you find in the literature is that negation is the operator that makes each instance of the &lt;em&gt;Law of the Excluded Middle&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt;) and the &lt;em&gt;Law of Non-Contradiction&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt;) turn out to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. That is, every sentence of the form
\[
p\lor \neg p
\qquad
\neg(p\land\neg p)
\]
is true, no matter what sentence we use in the place of \(p\) (where \(\neg\) stands for negation, \(\lor\) for disjunction, and \(\land\) for conjunction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; way to try to define negation. If you read on, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I explain why, though, I should explain that taking &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; as defining negation isn&amp;rsquo;t an idiosyncratic view. If you read &lt;a href=&#34;http://ling.yale.edu/people/laurence-r-horn&#34;&gt;Laurence Horn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contradiction&#34;&gt;entry on Contradiction in the &lt;em&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and I recommend you do read it, it&amp;rsquo;s a great discussion!), you&amp;rsquo;ll see that he characterises negation in this way. &lt;a href=&#34;http://grahampriest.net/&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s chapter &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://grahampriest.net/?ddownload=773&#34;&gt;Why Not? A Defence of a Dialethic Theory of Negation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; takes this form of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; to be central to defining what it is for one thing to be contradictory to another&amp;mdash;in terms of which Graham characterises negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s wrong to think that this form of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; defines negation: It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see (once you check) that &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t define &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. Altogether too many putative one-place connectives satisfy both &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that \(\mathord\sim A\) is just always interpreted as &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, whatever \(A\) happens to be. Then it turns out (if disjunction is interpreted in the usual way) that \(p\lor\mathord\sim p\) is true (since its second disjunct is true) and so is \(\mathord\sim(p\land\mathord\sim p)\) since it has the form \(\mathord\sim A\). So, given this deviant &amp;ldquo;negations are always true&amp;rdquo; interpretation, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; are always satisfied&amp;mdash;by \(\sim\), which isn&amp;rsquo;t negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t the only way one could interpret a sentential operator so as to satisfy &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt;. For an even more deviant reading, let&amp;rsquo;s interpret \(\mathord\sim A\) as \(\neg A\lor q\) for any \(A\) and for some sentence \(q\). Then &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; for \(\sim\)-negation,
that is,
\[
p\lor (\neg p\lor q)
\qquad
\neg(p\land(\neg p \lor q))\lor q
\]
are themselves &lt;em&gt;logically true&lt;/em&gt; (I leave the verification of this is an exercise for you). But \(\mathord\sim A\)&amp;mdash;that is, \(\neg A\lor q\)&amp;mdash;really isn&amp;rsquo;t the negation of \(A\). (If we choose \(q\) to be a &lt;em&gt;tautology&lt;/em&gt; then \(\mathord\sim A\) is simply equivalent to \(\top\) which is the interpretation we saw before.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if all we have to go on for interpreting &amp;ldquo;\(\sim\)&amp;rdquo; is that it satisfies  &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt;, then there many different ways it can be interpreted, including taking it to be highly contingent, where the semantic value of \(\mathord\sim A\) depends on more than just the semantic value of \(A\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;EXCURSUS&lt;/span&gt;: If you&amp;rsquo;re prepared to go further afield, notice that in reflexive classical modal logics, we have both \(p\lor\Diamond\neg p\) and \(\Diamond\neg(p\land\Diamond\neg p)\) so satisfying &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to tell us that we don&amp;rsquo;t mean &amp;ldquo;possibly not&amp;rdquo; by your so-called &amp;ldquo;negation&amp;rdquo;. And instead of \(\Diamond\neg\) you could use \(\Diamond\Diamond\neg\) or \(\Diamond\Diamond\Diamond\neg\)&amp;hellip; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a similar point in the context of first-order predicate logic, choose \(x\) to be a variable at random, and read \(\mathord\sim A\) as \((\exists x)\neg A\), whether \(x\) is free in the formula \(A\) &lt;em&gt;or not&lt;/em&gt;. Notice that this very strange variable-binding &amp;ldquo;negation&amp;rdquo; still satisfies &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt;, since \(A\lor (\exists x)\neg A\) and \((\exists x)\neg (A\land (\exists x)\neg A)\) are tautologies, but \((\exists x)\neg\) is not &lt;em&gt;negation&lt;/em&gt;. This bizarre creature binds a variable. Negation, as we traditionally understand it, doesn&amp;rsquo;t.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; in the traditional form don&amp;rsquo;t do enough by themselves to pin down negation, what can we say? Something I&amp;rsquo;ve argued &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/writing/lnclem/&#34;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is that the right way to understand &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; is more like this:
\[
\vdash p\lor \neg p
\qquad
p\land\neg p\vdash
\]
&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; (\(\vdash p\lor \neg p\)) tells us that \(p\lor\neg p\) is &lt;em&gt;undeniable&lt;/em&gt; (to &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;out of bounds&lt;/a&gt;), and this &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; (\(p\land\neg p\vdash\)) tells us that \(p\land\neg p\) is &lt;em&gt;unassertable&lt;/em&gt; (to &lt;em&gt;assert&lt;/em&gt; it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;out of bounds&lt;/a&gt;). This pair of rules does a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better job of pinning down the behaviour of negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how much better? Well, given a little more logic (the traditional sequent calculus rules for \(\land\) and \(\lor\), and the &lt;em&gt;Cut&lt;/em&gt; rule), then if \(\neg\) and \(\sim\) both satisfy &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; in this form, then both negations are logically equivalent. Here&amp;rsquo;s a demonstration that \(\mathord\sim A\vdash\neg A\) (you can generalise this to a proof of equivalence, though the dual proof of \(\neg A\vdash\mathord\sim A\)). Since \(A\land\mathord\sim A\vdash\), by the usual behaviour of \(\land\), we have \(A,\mathord\sim A\vdash\). Since \(\vdash A\lor\neg A\), by the usual behaviour of \(\lor\), we have \(\vdash A,\neg A\). From \(\vdash A,\neg A\) and \(A,\mathord\sim A\vdash\), by the &lt;em&gt;Cut&lt;/em&gt; rule (cutting on \(A\)) we have \(\mathord\sim A\vdash\neg A\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are tempted by the idea that &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; together &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; negation, you should be careful to specify &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; as a &lt;em&gt;denial&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;rejection&lt;/em&gt; rule (\(p\land\neg p\vdash\), which says that \(p\land\neg p\) is to be denied, or to be rejected), rather than \(\neg(p\land \neg p)\) which isn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough to say what you want it to say&amp;mdash;the &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; instances of negation gives you altogether too much wiggle room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is an argument that &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LNC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LEM&lt;/span&gt; actually &lt;em&gt;hold&lt;/em&gt;. For that, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added a search feature to the site in the &lt;a href=&#34;#footer&#34;&gt;footer&lt;/a&gt; of each page. There seems to be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news&#34;&gt;enough on the site&lt;/a&gt; that search is genuinely useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a href=&#34;http://duckduckgo.com&#34;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, which has a comprehensive index of this place, and which &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/params&#34;&gt;can be styled&lt;/a&gt; to match the visual treatment of the rest of the site.

      <title>Another Blast From the Past</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/another-blast-from-the-past/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/another-blast-from-the-past/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/LPWL@pitas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Logical Pluralism | Work Log&#34; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A blast from the past&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/recovering-the-past/&#34;&gt;recovering the archives for this site&lt;/a&gt;, I came across another blast from the past: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com&#34;&gt;weblog I ran&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://entailments.net&#34;&gt;Jc&lt;/a&gt; during the early days of our research on logical pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weblog&lt;/a&gt; that we ran from to October 1999 to September 2001, with things we found related to logical pluralism, notes from our research, and details of talks and various other bits and pieces along the way. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the nuances of logical pluralism, there&amp;rsquo;s lots of material there, some of which didn&amp;rsquo;t make it into &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism/&#34;&gt;our book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that in an age where many other free online services shut up shop and disappeared, the platform &amp;ldquo;pitas&amp;rdquo; is still faithfully serving up those pages. It launched in 1999, along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://diaryland.com&#34;&gt;Diaryland&lt;/a&gt;, which is still going strong after all of these years. (Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@maryps/a-conversation-with-andrew-smales-founder-of-diaryland-15e3d1ffc7dc&#34;&gt;the story of Andrew Smales, the founder, here&lt;/a&gt; for the backstory.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might also be worth noting that back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, I also favoured a simple &amp;ldquo;black and white with red highlights&amp;rdquo; colour scheme.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Recovering the Past</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/recovering-the-past/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2015 07:20:10 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/recovering-the-past/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If you glance at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news&#34;&gt;news archive&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that once again it stretches back to the dim past of weblog days, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/#2000&#34;&gt;the year 2000&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815223330/http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/&#34;&gt;wayback machine&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to recover entries from my old blog (powered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogger.com&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, from well before it was acquired by Google), and fulfil a commitment I made in March 2001 to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2001/2001_03_01_archive/&#34;&gt;move the old archives over to consequently.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the old news archives were &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20030630084127/http://consequently.org/news/archives.html&#34;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; for a little while here at &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org&#34;&gt;consequently.org&lt;/a&gt;, but once those entries disappeared from the server at Macquarie University, I dropped the links from the server. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered the articles, they&amp;rsquo;re back in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/#2000&#34;&gt;news archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entries from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2002/2002_03&#34;&gt;March 2002&lt;/a&gt; and earlier had no titles. This was an artefact of how Blogger was set up in the early years, before we used RSS feeds with titles to distribute blog entries. So, importing them into an archive where entries all &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have titles forced a choice. I took the easy way out, and decided that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2000/2000_03_01_archive&#34;&gt;month&amp;rsquo;s worth of entries&lt;/a&gt; was an &amp;lsquo;entry&amp;rsquo; in the new regime, with the title &amp;lsquo;News from &lt;em&gt;Month X&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo; They&amp;rsquo;re all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can browse through my early days of online writing, where the entries skip between &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2001/2001_06/#12&#34;&gt;short observations&lt;/a&gt; that now belong on twitter (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/speedysnail&#34;&gt;hi Rory!&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2001/2001_06/#13&#34;&gt;personal tales of life as a young father&lt;/a&gt; in short order, and the archive is relatively complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I thank the hardworking people at &lt;a href=&#34;http://archive.org&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt; who archive and index the history of the web. It&amp;rsquo;s been a pleasure (with its mixture of delight and embarrassment) to recover this history.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to be back in the office.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/consequently&#34;&gt;posting pictures on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; these days. I&amp;rsquo;ll include some here, but more are there, if you want to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Why no comment box?</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/no-comments/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2015 09:52:39 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/no-comments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Previous incarnations of this website provided a facility for comments in the usual way for a weblog in the first decade of the 2000s&amp;mdash;a comment form on each entry. This one doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple. Comment forms are ugly. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time &lt;em&gt;moderating comments&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;wading through yet another medium that&amp;rsquo;s 90% spam is  not a good way for me to use my time or energy. Publically available comment forms on the web are mostly buckets for spam and other detritus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, there are &lt;em&gt;plenty of other ways&lt;/em&gt; you can comment on anything I do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;reply to me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Use your favourite twitter client and post a link to news item you&amp;rsquo;re discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you include the reference to my twitter handle &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;@consequently&lt;/a&gt;,  or if you simply link to a page on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ll see your reply when I check twitter. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy for me to include tweets in posts, like this one &amp;hellip; &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-star logic workshop in Banff, 2007 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TT?src=hash&#34;&gt;#TT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl&#34;&gt;http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/yMX8yHufgn&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yMX8yHufgn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Richard Zach (@RrrichardZach) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RrrichardZach/status/558299627569836032&#34;&gt;January 22, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &amp;hellip; so if you&amp;rsquo;d like to comment, that&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get a short message out, in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got something that&amp;rsquo;s longer than a tweet&amp;rsquo;s worth, write it, make it available on the web, and let me know. If I get useful feedback in public, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to link to it on the page, or point readers to it on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you could always just &lt;a href=&#34;#about&#34;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;]]></description>

      <title>What’s the point of a personal website these days?</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/the-point/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 23:05:00 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2015/the-point/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My last post to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org&#34;&gt;consequently.org&lt;/a&gt; was in late in 2010, well over four years ago. You&amp;rsquo;d be &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; in thinking that I&amp;rsquo;d abandoned the place&amp;mdash;but you&amp;rsquo;d also be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with it behind the scenes. The software I&amp;rsquo;d been using to maintain the website has long since &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TwP/webby&#34;&gt;fallen into disrepair&lt;/a&gt;, so updating it meant porting everything to another content management system. At least, it would have to mean that, given that I &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; really keen to burn the whole thing to the ground and start again from scratch. This required &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t require &lt;em&gt;four years&lt;/em&gt;, but it did require an uninterrupted stretch of time to tinker with software, experiment with the design, and finally, piece everything back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting back into all of this website business, however, I wanted to answer one question. Is the investment of time worth it? &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the point of a personal website these days, anyway&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, people can &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;find me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where you might find a brief remark or more each week. (Or you might find a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=%23advent%20OR%20%23adventure%20OR%20%23christmas%20from%3Aconsequently%20since%3A2014-11-30%20until%3A2014-12-27&amp;amp;src=typd&#34;&gt;virtual “advent calendar”&lt;/a&gt; when I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a bit more adventurous.) I occasionally &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/consequently&#34;&gt;post photos on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see me there if you like that sort of thing. You can find (most of) &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfBBS7AAAAAJ&#34;&gt;my publications on Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, and you can even find &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/consequently/&#34;&gt;instructional videos I&amp;rsquo;ve made available to the public on Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. You can even join in with &lt;a href=&#34;http://coursera.org/course/logic1&#34;&gt;classes I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://coursera.org/course/logic2&#34;&gt;teach (with Jen Davoren) on Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, and you can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org&#34;&gt;philevents.org&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org/search/index/searchForm?span=PAST&amp;amp;customTag=&amp;amp;speakers%5B0%5D.id=1176&amp;amp;autonamespeaker=Greg+Restall&amp;amp;series=&amp;amp;search=true&amp;amp;hits=&amp;amp;widget=&amp;amp;Search=Search&#34;&gt;keep track of talks I&amp;rsquo;ve given&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;ve  been inactive on the web, even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t been leaving a much of a trace &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; lately. Isn&amp;rsquo;t all that web presence enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it isn&amp;rsquo;t. At least, it isn&amp;rsquo;t enough for me in 2015. Let me explain why, by turning to the different sections of this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;Publications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; section keeps track of all of my academic publications. Where I can, I archive pre- or post-publication versions of my papers, and sometimes I upload versions of papers here &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; submission, to get the ideas out as quickly as possible, and to get feedback. I could do that without having my own website. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://philpapers.org&#34;&gt;Philpapers.org&lt;/a&gt; is a great way for people to upload draft papers in philosophy, for example.) But at your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; site, you can present yourself however you see fit, and you can make it easy for people to find your work. You provide a &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; for  aggregators to aggregate. That&amp;rsquo;s one reason to take control of your own body of work. As long as the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol keeps going, I can host my own work and people can find it. &lt;em&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;philpapers&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;journal websites&lt;/em&gt; can come or go. As long as people can get here, they can keep track of my work. If someone asks how to keep up with what I write, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;ll point them. A &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; I control: &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;http://consequently.org/writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class&#34;&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; sections of the website were more pressing for me, though, as I thought about why it was important to have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;room of one&amp;rsquo;s own&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the web. I&amp;rsquo;ve been making more of my &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; resources available to the public, through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/gregrestall&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/consequently/&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. While I use our campus &lt;a href=&#34;https://lms.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;LMS&lt;/a&gt; to distribute materials to my on-campus students, that&amp;rsquo;s basically walled off to non-students. I can&amp;rsquo;t point non-Melbourne students to that if I want to give them access to teaching resources, or simply to catch up on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching. I&amp;rsquo;d like to have somewhere to do that. So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class&#34;&gt;http://consequently.org/class&lt;/a&gt; will serve as a directory of all my recent and future teaching resources—at least, all of the resources I&amp;rsquo;ll be making freely available to everyone, and it can be a straightforward first port-of-call for anyone who wants to check out a class I teach, to see if it interests them. Teaching is a very important part of what I do, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to spread this material far and wide if it will help others. I think it will help me, too: the more opportunities for feedback on teaching materials I get, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation&#34;&gt;Presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The same holds for &lt;em&gt;talks&lt;/em&gt; I give. I&amp;rsquo;d like there to be a simple, stable URL for each talk, whether it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/towards-fixed-point-models-logicmelb/&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/trmra-asubl5/&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/cemd-anu/&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/christian-academic-monash/&#34;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/tractatus-masterclass/&#34;&gt;kind of presentation&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll put materials from talks online, and sometimes I won&amp;rsquo;t. But in any case, I want to have an archive of recent and upcoming talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news&#34;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt; section of the website, which can be the home for not-academic pieces of writing which don&amp;rsquo;t fit well into &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;140 character&lt;/a&gt; chunks, and which don&amp;rsquo;t find a place in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;more considered pieces&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; These are pieces of writing like &lt;em&gt;this very discussion&lt;/em&gt;. While some find places like &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; a suitable home for longer-than-twitter online writing, I&amp;rsquo;m fond of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/catarinadutilhnovaes/&#34;&gt;people&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umsu.de/wo/&#34;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://kjhealy.org&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m itching to get back into it, with some occasional writing of my own, to supplement more considered academic pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of my return to this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s end with the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;. The short answer is what you see in the footer of the website (as I write this). &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is the CMS that wires things together into the website. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, relatively straightforward to learn if you&amp;rsquo;re used to command-line tools, and can it cope with the not-completely-straightforward taxonomy of my site. Hugo seems to be under active development by its founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/spf13/&#34;&gt;Steve Francia&lt;/a&gt; together with an active &lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; of users and developers. It looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll be around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hand-coded the HTML (designing it to be &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; friendly for small-screen devices) using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://imperavi.com/kube/&#34;&gt;Kube Web Framework&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://imperavi.com&#34;&gt;Imperavi&lt;/a&gt;. (Please let me know if you see any website design bugs.) The main body and header font is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya&#34;&gt;Alegreya&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous font designed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/juandelperal&#34;&gt;Juan Pablo del Peral&lt;/a&gt; for the Argentinian Type Foundry &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huertatipografica.com&#34;&gt;Huerta Tipogr&amp;aacute;fica&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya&#34;&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;. Apply liberal doses of &lt;a href=&#34;http://marketlane.com.au&#34;&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cockburnproject.net&#34;&gt;Bruce Cockburn&lt;/a&gt;, a few late nights&amp;rsquo; worth of coding, and you get the website you have before you. I hope you like it. Please get back to me, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;replying to @consequently&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, or by email, if you have any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2010/11/16/testing_testing_1_2_3/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2010/11/16/testing_testing_1_2_3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Just testing to see if this thing is on.  Yes, it seems to be working.  How about that!? It&amp;rsquo;s pretty rusty, but apparently this site still works. That&amp;rsquo;s good to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few items of news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been way too busy coordinating the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Philosophy program&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Melbourne to be posting here. It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy ride for the year, but it&amp;rsquo;s been fantastic. It looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll be in the saddle again for 2011, so hopefully having learned how to hold the reins this year, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to post here a little more next year.  No promises though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing. Doing lots of writing.  You&amp;rsquo;ll see a few changes on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; page. I&amp;rsquo;m most happy with the new paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;A Cut-Free Sequent System for Two-Dimensional Modal Logic: and why it matters&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s a little philosophy there, and a little proof theory, too. It&amp;rsquo;s not too long (just 24 pages), and I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate your comments. Head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;paper page&lt;/a&gt; to download the paper and post your comments.  (Make sure you admire the in-line diagrams on page 16. That&amp;rsquo;s LaTeX, with no postprocessing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next travels involve a trip to Guangzhou to take part in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.helsinki.fi/logic/sellc-2010/&#34;&gt;SELLC 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s going to be a blast, helping teach a Winter School to a bunch of enthusiastic students, and with a great slate of lecturers. It&amp;rsquo;ll be good to catch up with Samson, Robin, Mehrnoosh and Dag, and to meet the rest of the lecturers, as well as my colleagues at the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;ILC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at Sun Yat-Sen University.  On the way home from Guangzhou, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick side trip to Boston for the Eastern &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;APA&lt;/span&gt;, to contribute to a session on the future of logic, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~horty/&#34;&gt;John Horty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan/&#34;&gt;Johan van Benthem&lt;/a&gt;.  What fun!  This will be my first ever &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;APA&lt;/span&gt;, so if you have any advice for an &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;APA&lt;/span&gt; neophyte, do let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Time Flies</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/10/20/time_flies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/10/20/time_flies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time flies like an arrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fruit flies like a banana.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following my &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;d realise I&amp;rsquo;m still alive.  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think that from the activity &amp;ndash; or lack thereof &amp;ndash; here.  (Though a few papers have appeared &amp;ndash; or changed their publication status &amp;ndash; on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing page&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where we are: It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy, eventful semester, and the teaching period is almost done.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had fun teaching proof theory to fourth-year students, tutoring intro philosophy to first years, and supervising graduate students (at last count, I have eight current research students in various stages of the degrees).  One of the sadder things to befall us here at Melbourne is the departure of Allen Hazen, who as left our shores for the chillier climes of Edmonton.  The Melbourne logic community&amp;rsquo;s loss is Canada&amp;rsquo;s gain here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;m off on a short trip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/ICLC2009/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=760&#34;&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, by way of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~arche/events/event?id=212&#34;&gt;St. Andrews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy/department/events/phs_seminars/phs_seminars.html&#34;&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s the long way around, but somebody has got to do it.  I&amp;rsquo;m busy clearing the decks here of as much as I can before the trip.  One of the decks to be cleared is this blog, so a post is in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posting about not posting for a long time is so &lt;em&gt;pass&amp;eacute;&lt;/em&gt;, so here&amp;rsquo;s a link to something you might like if you&amp;rsquo;re a logic person like me.  Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/&#34;&gt;Wandering Mango&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s program &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/&#34;&gt;Deductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Mac OS X only).  It&amp;rsquo;s a very neat natural deduction educational tool: it helps you produce valid Fitch-style natural deduction proofs, using the format of the major texts used in intro teaching.  Well, as far as I can tell, they&amp;rsquo;re the major texts ued in intro teaching in North America.  In Australia, in Europe, in the UK, logic is taught in different ways: &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=SFa6AIB1Ct8C&#34;&gt;Smullyan-style tableaux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=2sCuDMUruSUC&#34;&gt;Gentzen tree-style natural deduction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=PSXdSp29LZKWlQTMzqCeAQ&#34;&gt;Lemmon-style linear natural deduction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;though see the update below&lt;/em&gt;) with labels, etc.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot you need to do if you&amp;rsquo;re going to cover the ground of all the ways of teaching introductory logic by way of &amp;lsquo;proofs&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in touch with the developer, and he tells me this is only the beginning for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/videos.html&#34;&gt;Deductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s built in a modular fashion, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to start extending it to cover more systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you teach logic, or if you&amp;rsquo;re learning logic and you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn it by having a proof assistant on side to keep your proofs on track &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/videos.html&#34;&gt;take a look at &lt;em&gt;Deductions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update on December 8, 2009&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sfu.ca/~jeffpell/&#34;&gt;Jeff Pelletier&lt;/a&gt; reminds me in an email that Lemmon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=PSXdSp29LZKWlQTMzqCeAQ&#34;&gt;beginning logic&lt;/a&gt; was not the first to introduce what I called &amp;lsquo;Lemmon-style&amp;rsquo; linear natural deduction. Patrick Suppes, in his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=jFRwDqpoN2UC&#34;&gt;Introduction to Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For more on ths history of natural deduction, a great place to start is Jeff&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/NDHistory.pdf&#34;&gt;A Brief History of Natural Deduction&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Thanks for that, Jeff!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Posting has been light, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been powering through work at the end of the semester, and getting ready for a quick trip west to Europe, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.cs.cas.cz/~ncm/&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Mathematics 2009&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=1297&#34;&gt;Logica 2009&lt;/a&gt;, preceded by a quick &lt;a href=&#34;http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/philosophische_fakultaet/iph/termine/vortrag_restall&#34;&gt;visit to Dresden&lt;/a&gt; to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tu-dresden.de/phfiph/prof/lowiphil/hwa.htm&#34;&gt;Heinrich Wansing&lt;/a&gt;, and to break up the train trip from Frankfurt to Prague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, posting here has paused for a bit, but now that I&amp;rsquo;m settled in Hejnice and that there&amp;rsquo;s a wireless connection here, I can deal with some of my backlog of things I&amp;rsquo;ve promised to post.  So, here&amp;rsquo;s a salad of links for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Faculty, the Arts Faculty, at the University of Melbourne, is holding a short &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/futurestudents/research/winter-school.html&#34;&gt;Winter School&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;July 15 and 16&lt;/em&gt;, for students from Ausralia (but outside Victoria), to come and get a taste of the range of research done in the Faculty.  If you&amp;rsquo;re from inside Australia but outside Victoria, you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;lsquo;high achieving honours student&amp;rsquo;, and you&amp;rsquo;d like a trip to Melbourne to see what we do, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/futurestudents/research/winter-school.html&#34;&gt;please apply&lt;/a&gt;.  Applications close June 22, so you&amp;rsquo;ve got to be quick!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m helping organise &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/iclc2009/&#34;&gt;ICLC2009&lt;/a&gt;, the Intenational Conference on Logic and Cognition at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, held from &lt;em&gt;November 2 to 4, 2009&lt;/em&gt;. The deadline for getting your paper in for this conference is a leisurely &lt;em&gt;October 1, 2009&lt;/em&gt;.  Guangzhou is great (&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2008/11/14/off_to_guangzhou/&#34;&gt;I was there last year&lt;/a&gt; and had a wonderful time at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/&#34;&gt;Institute for Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;), and if you can come along, please do &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/ICLC2009/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=757&#34;&gt;submit a paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Griffin and Bernard Linsky are hosting &lt;a href=&#34;http://pm100.mcmaster.ca/&#34;&gt;PM@100&lt;/a&gt;, a conference on the 100th Anniversary of the publication of &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt;. That conference is from &lt;em&gt;21&amp;ndash;24 May, 2010&lt;/em&gt; at McMaster University in Ontario, and paper submissions are due only on &lt;em&gt;January 1, 2010&lt;/em&gt;, so for this you have more time to get things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no deadline at all for joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/&#34;&gt;Friends of the SEP Society&lt;/a&gt;.  Are you a Friend of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;?  So many of us &amp;ndash; students, academics, interested readers &amp;ndash; use it for our research, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great resource for everyone.  If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular user of the SEP (and if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in philosophy, who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be?), consider joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/&#34;&gt;the Society&lt;/a&gt; to help support the work of the Encyclopedia.  For a small fee, you support the encyclopedia, you help it keep up its mission of free, high quality introductions to philosophical themes &amp;ndash; and you get access to great quality PDF versions of the entries in the SEP, which are just ideal for printing out and reading (and annotating) offline.  You also (if you like) get email notifications whenever the articles you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded get updated.  It&amp;rsquo;s a good deal, and it&amp;rsquo;s much cheaper (at US$25 a year for a full subscription, down to US$5 a year for a student subscription) than a journal subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to posting on more substantial things later.  Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got a conference to attend. For little quips along the way, you can follow the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Rumfitt on Multiple Conclusions, Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is Part 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1&#34;&gt;a series of comments&lt;/a&gt; on Ian Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;Knowledge by Deduction&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Grazer Philosophische Studien&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 77 (2008) pp. 61&amp;ndash;84).  In &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I focussed on Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s direct criticism of my approach in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; and I tried to show that his criticism missed the mark, and that it missed the mark in an important way. The norms of logical consequence and logical coherence apply not only to occurrent beliefs but to all manner of states of accepting and rejecting (or acts of assertion and denial), whether they express our deep standing beliefs or hypotheses we simply entertain lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, I want to consider the comments on the possibility of genuine &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt; with multiple conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumfitt writes (and I&amp;rsquo;ll quote him at some length here), on page 79:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rarity, to the point of extinction, of naturally occurring multiple-conclusion arguments has always been the reason why mainstream logicians have dismissed multiple-conclusion logic as little more than a curiosity. (See e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Taming-True-Neil-Tennant/dp/0198237170/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Tennant 1997&lt;/a&gt;, 320.) And attempts by enthusiasts to alleviate the embarrassment here have often ended up compounding it. In the introduction to their textbook on the subject, Shoesmith and Smiley concede that multiple-conclusion proofs can scarcely be said to form part of the everyday repertoire of mathematics. &amp;lsquo;Perhaps the nearest one comes to them&amp;rsquo;, they go on, &amp;ldquo;is in proof by cases, where one argues &amp;ldquo;suppose &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;; &amp;hellip; suppose &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; then &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;; but &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &amp;hellip; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. A diagrammatic representation of this argument exhibits the downward branching which we shall see is typical of formalised multiple-conclusion proofs &amp;hellip; But the ordinary proof by cases is at best a degenerate form of multiple-conclusion argument, for the different conclusions are all the same (in our example they are all instances of the same formula &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith and Smiley 1978&lt;/a&gt;, 4–5). &amp;ldquo;At best degenerate&amp;rdquo;, though, hardly says it. I do not know how the word &amp;ldquo;multiple&amp;rdquo; is used in Cambridge, but in the rest of the English-speaking world it is understood to mean &amp;ldquo;more than one&amp;rdquo;. So an example of an argument in which all the conclusions (&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;) are identical provides little justification for taking multiple-conclusion logic seriously. But since this is all that Shoesmith and Smiley provide by way of a positive case for deeming their system to be a branch of logic, readers of their book may be forgiven for closing it with a sigh on reaching p. 5 of the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, in defence of Shoesmith and Smiley, the one example of proof by cases (in which the intermediate formula are all the same) is not the only consideration they provide in favour of taking their system to be a branch of logic.  Showing that it is a codification of a notion of (let&amp;rsquo;s call it) &lt;em&gt;quasi&lt;/em&gt;-proof which delivers logical consequence on Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequents, and which, when restricted to single conclusion deductions agrees with traditional natural deduction should count for something.  If it&amp;rsquo;s not a branch of logic, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, a single case where the only multiple conclusions aren&amp;rsquo;t very multiple is not very satisfying. But there is a genuine sense, of course, in which even in this case the conclusions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; multiple.  Surely they have heard of the type&amp;ndash;token distinction outside of Cambridge?  There is a perfectly admissible sense in which the rule of conjunction introduction (in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s natural deduction) requires &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; premises, even when the instance used is a derivation of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;.  (To rewrite this to be a proof from one instance of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; may radically change the structure of the proof, especially if both instances of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; are proved in very different ways.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is a minor point, not worth any more of our time.  More important is the way that Rumfitt missed what is going on in proofs by cases.  I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that he missed my example of a proof featuring multiple conclusions, discussed in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; on page 199 to address just the point Rumfitt raised here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose everyone is either happy or tired. Choose a person. It follows that this person is either happy or tired. There are two cases. Case (i) this person is happy. Case (ii) this person is tired, and as a result someone is tired. As a result, either this person is happy or someone (namely that person) is tired. But the person we chose was arbitrary, so either everyone is happy or someone is tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to me to be perfectly valid reasoning: It&amp;rsquo;s a proof.  It&amp;rsquo;s a renderng in (somewhat) natural language of a sequent derivation of &amp;ldquo;everything is an &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or something is a &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;everything is either &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  (For the sequent derivation I used, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this proof, there are two conclusions active at a number of points.  Stop the proof before the sentence starting &amp;ldquo;As a result&amp;rdquo;.  Consider the state of play at this point in the derivation.  We have a proof from &amp;ldquo;Everyone is either happy or tired&amp;rdquo; to the two conclusions: &amp;ldquo;Case (i) &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is happy.&amp;rdquo; (where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is an eigenvariable standing for &amp;lsquo;that person&amp;rsquo;, which in turn points back to the choice made after the supposition.)  &amp;ldquo;Case (ii) someone is tired.&amp;rdquo;  In other words, we have a proof corresponding to the sequent (everything is either &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;Fa&lt;/em&gt;, something is &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot think of any way of understanding the deduction up to that point in such a way as to (a) see it as a single deduction, and (b) not introduce irrelevant connectives not explicitly used in the text.  This example seems to me to be strong evidence that one can find in nature real-life uses of multiple conclusions in action, if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know where to look, you know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need tricky cases of intuitionistically invalid arguments to make the point.  The point is there in Shoesmith and Smiley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; examples of proof by cases.  If you stop a proof by cases (in the middle of the ellipses eliding the interesting bits of the subproofs, in the bit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith &amp;amp; Smiley&lt;/a&gt; quoted by Rumfitt) you will get more interesting cases where the conclusions in play differ.  For example, take this proof of (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;). (Ignore the bracketed markers [a], [b] and [c] for the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  Then it follows that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  It follows that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  So, we have two cases: (i) &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and (ii) &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;. [a] Consider case (i).  Here, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and we already have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.  Consider case (ii). Here, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;, and we already have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;. [b].  Back in case (i), it follows that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  In (ii), it also follows that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) [c].  So, we conclude, (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this seems to me to be perfectly understandable reasoning.  The point at which Rumfitt jokes about &amp;lsquo;multiple&amp;rsquo; instances of the conclusion &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; corresponds to our point [c], where we have proved the conclusion (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) in each case, but have not yet drawn them together to a single conclusion in the argument.  True, at this point we have a proof with two instances of the one concluding formula.  This is no better or worse than a proof with two instances of the one premise formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But [c] is only one place to stop the proof.  Suppose we pause at point [b].  What do we have there?  It&amp;rsquo;s a proof from one premise &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;), leading to two cases, one in which we&amp;rsquo;ve proved &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and the other in which we&amp;rsquo;ve proved &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  This corresponds to the sequent &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;, and the two concluding formulas are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let me confess: I engineered this case by interleaving the two cases in the text, to get to an intermediate step in both of them.  But this does not render the case any less salient.  I could have stopped at point [a], and here, what we have got to is a sequent &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  In other words, we have just got to the point at which the disjunction is broken up into two cases, and each case is ready for further processing using the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the core idea of multiple conclusion &lt;em&gt;natural deduction&lt;/em&gt;.  The disjunction rule can be understood simply, as taking us from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; to the two conclusions &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;,  which can then be operated on as usual, in the &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; proof.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t like this, that&amp;rsquo;s fine.  However, that is not an argument to the effect that multiple conclusion structures can&amp;rsquo;t be found in natural reasoning.  They are there if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few days I&amp;rsquo;ll post a response to what I take to be the most interesting of Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s arguments, his considerations against the Cut Rule.  But that, I suspect, will take a little more time, and other duties are pressing for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, comments on these ideas are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Rumfitt on Multiple Conclusions, Part 1</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/rumfitt_part_1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/rumfitt_part_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2009/05/its-end-of-logic-as-we-know-it.html&#34;&gt;Thanks to Ole Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been alerted to Ian Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;Knowledge by Deduction&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Grazer Philosophische Studien&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 77 (2008) pp. 61&amp;ndash;84.).  In it, he makes a number of critical comments on multiple conclusion accounts of logical consequence, and in particular, he makes some critical remarks on my paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  Now, the criticism of mutiple conclusion consequence isn&amp;rsquo;t the main point of the paper&amp;mdash;the main topic is how one can acquire knowlege by deduction, as the title indicates. On that topic, it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting paper, and I hope to comment on those parts at some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since the paper ends with the sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have found reason to leave multiple-conclusion logics to the boy racers, and focus on the single-conclusion rules, by following which we can splice together the deliverances of various sources of knowledge to come to know things that we could not know otherwise.  (page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the criticism of multiple conclusion consequence plays a significant role in the paper, and in how Rumfitt thinks of the topic of acquiring knowledge by deduction.  The &amp;lsquo;boy racer&amp;rsquo; image&amp;mdash;which I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is not intended to be flattering to people like me who have advocated multiple conclusion logics&amp;mdash;arises out of an argument to the effect that multiple conclusion logics are finely tuned machines, which are fiddly to maintain, like a sports car.  I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the metaphor for readers to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the criticism I should reply in some kind of public forum, to get a response out there.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem appropriate to write an extensive essay just in response to a few points made in one paper, though I may make the remarks in some other paper I&amp;rsquo;m writing if it is appropriate to the topic at hand.  But I have a weblog, it seems like the appropraite avenue for responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got three comments to make. They are, in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s explicit criticism of my &amp;lsquo;overplaying my hand,&amp;rsquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2009/05/its-end-of-logic-as-we-know-it.html&#34;&gt;cited by Ole&lt;/a&gt; in the post that drew my attention to Ian&amp;rsquo;s paper.  This is taken up &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1/#readon&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s point that multiple conclusion deductions aren&amp;rsquo;t found in nature.  (This point is, of course, not limited to Rumfitt.  It&amp;rsquo;s found throughout the literature, predominantly in response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith and Smiley&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt;.)  This is taken up in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/03/Rumfitt_Part_2&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s interesting argument concerning the multiple conclusion &lt;em&gt;Cut Rule&lt;/em&gt; being properly stronger than mere transitivity. (This is the point at which the metaphor of the sports car appears.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making all three comments in the one post seems excessive.  So I&amp;rsquo;ll make the first comment here, and leave the other two for later posts in the next little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can tell you &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; story, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to tell you &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; story.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn&#34;&gt;&amp;darr;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;ret&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  What is multiple conclusion consequence?  It is what is presented in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus for classical logic.  A multiple conclusion consequence links a number (maybe zero, maybe more) of premises &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; with a number (maybe zero, maybe more) of conclusions &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.  We say that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; if there&amp;rsquo;s a sequent derivation of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.  The soundness and completeness theorem linking Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus to models for classical logic tells us that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; if and only if there is no model (and assignment of values to the variables, if we allow free variables in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;) in which each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is satisfied and no member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is satisfied.   Formally speaking, multiple conclusion consequence is impeccable when it comes to classical logic, and its fragments such as distributive lattice logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my favoured approach (discussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;), the multiple conclusion consequence from &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; makes &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; as saying that a position in which every member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is asserted and every member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is denied is self-defeating.  (I&amp;rsquo;ll have more to say about what it is to be self-defeating in the salient sense, below.)  For example, (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) entails &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; and yes, asserting the inclusive disjunction of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; while at the very same time denying &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is to make a mistake&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s for the very claims to undercut one another in a very special way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Rumfitt doesn&amp;rsquo;t like this approach. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s explicit criticism of the earliest exposition I have given of the ideas, in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  He writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this case for multiple conclusions is presented in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Restall 2005&lt;/a&gt;. But he overplays his hand in suggesting that &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is a multiple-conclusion consequence of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; can be explained as meaning &amp;lsquo;The mental state of accepting all of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and rejecting all of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; would be self-defeating&amp;rsquo;. The mental state that consists of accepting that there will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo;, while rejecting that very statement, is self-defeating. But &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; is in no sense a consequence of &amp;lsquo;There will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;ldquo;There is a god&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: I just don&amp;rsquo;t agree with Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s premise in the argument.  I don&amp;rsquo;t agree that accepting (a) that there will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; and (b) rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; are jointly self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, (a) and (b) jointly involve doing something for which there will never be sufficient grounds, but &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; not what is required for self-defeat in anything like any of the senses I was discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why.  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice this from Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s summary of the position in &amp;ldquo;Multiple Conclusions&amp;rdquo; but I was careful to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; restrict the story of self-defeat (later traded in for the notion of incoherence) to occurrent beliefs or other mental states.  In fact, though I talk about accepting and rejecting in the paper, I was careful to allow that this makes sense even in those cases where we accept claims &lt;em&gt;hypothetically&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;for the sake of the argument&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Suppse &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I say.  If you&amp;rsquo;re following along, then under the scope of this supposition, you accept &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.   You reaon &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  If you also accept &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; then, under this scope, it would be a mistake to reject &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.  This is clearly something we do, and we want a notion of logical consequence to apply under the scope of such suppositions or hypotheses.  (It&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how we could make sense of the rule of conditional proof and what goes on when we reason like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; without some such move.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in this discussion, one should never limit accepting and rejecting to occurrent mental states like belief and disbelief.  That will limit the range of applicability of the notion of logical consequence too much.  This was one reason I used &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;believe&amp;rsquo;, and why I was careful to also talk of &amp;lsquo;assertion&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;denial&amp;rsquo;, for one can similarly assert under the scope of a supposition, in a dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, consider what we might say about Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s case and the position in which I accept that there is not and will never be any sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting the statement &amp;lsquo;There is a god.&amp;rsquo;  OK. Let&amp;rsquo;s, for the sake of the argument, &lt;em&gt;grant&lt;/em&gt; that.  And let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that we &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; it.  Now, consider this:  I ask you to consider what would be the case if, as a matter of fact, there were a god.  You are quite well within your rights to say that in that case, there would be a god and that despite that fact, there would still be no grounds for accepting or rejecting the claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think you&amp;rsquo;d be right, and I think that in that discussion, under the scope of that supposition, we have a case where we (conditionally) accept &amp;lsquo;there is a god&amp;rsquo; and accept &amp;lsquo;there is no grounds for accepting or rejecting the statement &amp;lsquo;there is a god&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rsquo; and where we do so completely coherently, with no self-defeat at all.  There is something epistemically defective, of course, in thinking that we are &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; such a circumstance as described under that supposition.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not required.  That&amp;rsquo;s the joy of assertion and denial, and of accepting and rejecting.  We can make them fly beyond the limits of what we happen to believe (and disbelieve) at the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I don&amp;rsquo;t accept the premise of Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s argument: I submit that it&amp;rsquo;s a too-narrow reading of &amp;lsquo;accepting&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;rejecting&amp;rsquo; (not allowing enough to count) and a too-wide reading of &amp;lsquo;self-defeat&amp;rsquo; (allowing too much to count).  If you understand &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;reject&amp;rsquo; broadly enough&amp;mdash;as I think we must&amp;mdash;then the right notion of self-defeat is much easier to pin down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else do I say about the notion of self-defeat?  In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets/&#34;&gt;on this&lt;/a&gt; I have not used the term &amp;lsquo;self-defeat&amp;rsquo; for it is too easily confused with epistemic notions of assertion without warrant.  (Lloyd Humberstone pointed out a few years ago in conversation that you might worry about Moore paradoxical sentences on my approach, so I have been aware of this issue for some time.)  Instead, I have used the more abstract terms of art such as involving a &amp;lsquo;clash,&amp;rsquo; being &amp;lsquo;incoherent&amp;rsquo; or being &amp;lsquo;out of bounds&amp;rsquo; when talking about positions [&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;] where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.   What is involved in such a clash?  The clash in the assertion of each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and the denial of each member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, whatever it is, is the kind of clash involved in asserting &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  Its normative force, whatever it is, is not just any old force (like that of asserting something for which there is no evidence, or of denying something true).  The connective rules for the sequent calculus show how &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; clashes can be reduced to this basic clash between assertion and denial of the one thing.  Exactly how that reduction goes, and what one can say about the Cut Rule (which also connects clashes with other clashes), I&amp;rsquo;ll leave for another time.  For now, I hope to have shown that Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s case, and other Moore paradoxical cases, don&amp;rsquo;t cause any concern for the position in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I&amp;rsquo;ll consider other points from Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s interesting article, but that seems like enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  I&amp;rsquo;d value feedback on this, as I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make sure that the position is &lt;em&gt;clearly explained&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;convincing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;d settle for &lt;em&gt;clearly explained&lt;/em&gt; though I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fn&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a prize to send to the first person who posts a comment explaining what highbrow cultural reference I just made: the offer is valid for one week, until June 8, 2009.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post the answer if no-one has got it by then. &lt;a href=&#34;#ret&#34;&gt;&amp;uarr;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Problems for Naïve Property Theories</title>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/05/21/problems_for_naive_theories_of_properties/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about generalisations of Russell&amp;rsquo;s paradox, cleaning things up so you can&amp;rsquo;t get around the problem by changing the logic of connectives. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that mucking around with &lt;em&gt;negation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;implication&lt;/em&gt; gets to the heart of the issue.  (This view is shared by some very &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/view?isbn=0262071444&#34;&gt;insightful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11225-009-9177-2&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t come to it alone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting around negation and conditionals is surprisingly easy, once you get the proof theory sorted out.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been noodling about with this issue for a year or so now.  I presented on this in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;talk at the World Congress of Paraconsistency&lt;/a&gt; last year, and a bit of it has appeared in my draft &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/stp/&#34;&gt;discussion of some themes from Hartry Field&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Saving Truth From Paradox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, the paradoxical derivations are done in sequent calculi, and they&amp;rsquo;re not the most perspicuous presentation.  I managed to sharpen it up a bit tonight, and the resulting proof is &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s not explained in the text of that note: that gives just the definitions and the proof. I hope to get to that soon.  But let me use this site to get the ideas out in a rough and ready form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of the idea is this.  Folks like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Contradiction-Study-Transconsistent-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263302/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Truth-Paradox-Hartry-Field/dp/0199230757/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Hartry Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt; think that for every description &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) there&amp;rsquo;s a property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; such that &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;).  An object &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; instantiates the property  &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; if and only if &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).  The traditional problem is this: consider the property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t instantiate &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;.  Does this instantiate itself or not?  If it does, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions favoured by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Contradiction-Study-Transconsistent-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263302/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Truth-Paradox-Hartry-Field/dp/0199230757/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Beall&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics/&#34;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/dlpsr&#34;&gt;former self&lt;/a&gt;), though they differ in details, all agree that we should muck around with the logic of negation.  (And also the logic of the conditional, as the property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;: if &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; instantiates &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then I&amp;rsquo;m a monkey&amp;rsquo;s uncle&amp;gt; is just as problematic: see &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/&#34;&gt;Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;pain&lt;/em&gt; to worry about each different tweak to the logic of negation and the logic of the conditional, and worry about whether this patch or that fix really does solve the problem.  (It&amp;rsquo;s a fun pain, if you like that kind of thing, but a pain nonetheless.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at formulations of the problem that avoid all talk of negation, conditionals and other stuff my friends and colleagues can argy bargy about.  Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make do with the logic of instantiation (that&amp;rsquo;s implicit in the so-called na&amp;iuml;ve theory of properties, for which each description &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) has a corresponding  property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; which is &amp;phi;.  An object &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; instantiates the property  &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; if and only if &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).)  So, we adopt two inference rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] From &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;) infer &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;] From &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; infer &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for each open sentence &amp;phi;(&amp;nbsp;).  (The &amp;lsquo;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rsquo; is our shorthand for &amp;lsquo;instantiates.&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we need two more things.  First, a sentence that is pretty bad.  One from which we can infer everything will do the trick.  (If you have a universal quantifier around, &amp;lsquo;everything instantiates everything&amp;rsquo; will do nicely.  But it isn&amp;rsquo;t mandatory.)  In other words, we have a &amp;lsquo;&amp;perp;&amp;rsquo; for which&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;]  From &amp;perp; infer any sentence you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need the logic of identity for properties.  You need to have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; account of when &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; = &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;psi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; for different sentences &amp;phi; and &amp;psi;.  It&amp;rsquo;d be odd to say that the property of being red and square was a different property from the property of being square and red, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it?  (The extant na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties say little about this.  The extant consistency or non-triviality proofs for na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties, alas, make different descriptions denote &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; properties, which is not what you should want.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can we say that would rule out out distinctions where there is no difference at all?  What identity condition works for this sort of property?  Extensionality is the identity condition for &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt;.  If the things in set &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; are the same as the things in set &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are the same set.  That&amp;rsquo;s clearly too strong for properties.  (Think renates and cordates, or featherless bipeds and humans.)  But if I can deduce that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, and vice versa (where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is aribtrary), using deduction alone and no contingent side conditions, then what difference could there be between property &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and property &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;?  None that I can see, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.  This motivates the following condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;]  If I can deduce &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;, with no other side conditions, discharge those assumptions and infer &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Parenthetical remark: that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; mean that being H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is the same property as being water, unless you think you can infer that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is water, and vice versa, using logic alone.  You can think that they are necessarily coextensive without thinking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.  We&amp;rsquo;re not identifying properties coarsely.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] tells us when two properties are identical.  We need to know what we can infer from the claim that two properties are identical.  That seems straightforward.  You only get out what you put in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;]  From &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, infer &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s five simple inference principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those five inference principles are enough for you to deduce &amp;perp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bad, since from &amp;perp; one can validly deduce everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we deduce &amp;perp;?  We use identity and &amp;perp; to do what we wanted negation to do before our friends and colleagues said negation didn&amp;rsquo;t do that.  That is, consider &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; = &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;perp;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, consider the property of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; such that the property that anything has when &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; instantiates itself as a property is the same thing as the property that nothing has.  (In other words, consider the property of not being self instantiating, but we won&amp;rsquo;t say that, since we have nice arguments about the logic of negation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using [&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] and [=&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;] alone, we can deduce &amp;perp;.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the proof&lt;/a&gt;.  It has fifteen steps, each one of which is one of those five rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a serious problem for anyone who likes na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties.  You&amp;rsquo;ve got to say which of those rules break down: and by &amp;lsquo;break down&amp;rsquo; I mean something very precise.  For which of the rules [&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] and [=&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;]  are you prepared to accept the premise and reject the conclusion?  If you can&amp;rsquo;t do that, then a forced march down &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;the proof&lt;/a&gt; suffices to commit you to &amp;perp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what will it be?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Earlier today I received the sad news that Bob Meyer, my former colleague at the ANU, and friend, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/strenge&#34;&gt;two-time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/desecsed&#34;&gt;collaborator&lt;/a&gt;, died last night, after a long struggle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob will be sorely missed by many of us. His warmth and humour, his brilliance, and his willingness to talk logic (and much more) to anyone and everyone, will all be impossible to replace.  If I manage to show a small fraction of both his logical insight, and his ability to communicate difficult concepts with good humour and wit, I&amp;rsquo;ll be a happy philosophical logician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I&amp;rsquo;m off to Adelaide for one of our many Adelaide&amp;ndash;Melbourne logic weekend funfests. This time it will be a bittersweet occasion, with many opportunities share our stories of the Maximum Leader of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/manifesto.html&#34;&gt;Logicians&amp;rsquo; Liberation League&lt;/a&gt;, and to toast his passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, David Chalmers &lt;a href=&#34;http://fragments.consc.net/djc/2009/05/bob-m.html&#34;&gt;remembers Bob fondly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consc.net/cgi-bin/picsearch.pl?keyw=meyer&#34;&gt;links to some photos&lt;/a&gt;, and points to Bob&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2215186&#34;&gt;notorious paper&lt;/a&gt; in which he proves that God&amp;rsquo;s existence is equivalent to the axiom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Bob, for all you&amp;rsquo;ve done for me.  My work and my life has been enriched in having you as a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Allen Hazen pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=67&#34;&gt;this nice interview&lt;/a&gt; Julian Bagnini conducted with Ernie Lepore, on words. Lepore comes to the same sort of conclusion as Kaplan &amp;ndash; that identity conditions for words are tricky.  He&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Types, Tokens and Names</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/03/27/types_tokens_and_names/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/03/27/types_tokens_and_names/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The quote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s quiz&lt;/a&gt; was from the inimitable &lt;a href=&#34;http://admin.cdh.ucla.edu/webpage.php?par=98&#34;&gt;David Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, in the article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/4106880&#34;&gt;Words&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society&lt;/em&gt;, Supplementary Volume, LXIV 1990).  As Robbie mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/&#34;&gt;in the comments&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a cool paper.  I want to give an example of how cool it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think of &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;, repeatable things that the are, as the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;token&lt;/em&gt; inscriptions, jottings, arrangements of pixels, utterances and all of the other kinds of ways we find to express words.  Kaplan argues in &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; that this isn&amp;rsquo;t right.  I won&amp;rsquo;t rehearse the argument here, but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about one example he gives along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the special case of names.  My name &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; is, in one sense, the same name as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/gregory-currie.php&#34;&gt;Greg Currie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s name &amp;ndash; we share the generic name &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo;.  In another sense, in the sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Arts-Minds-Gregory-Currie/dp/0199256284/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Arts and Minds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but Greg wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Logic-Introduction-Fundamentals-Greg-Restall/dp/0415400686/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the two uses of the string &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; are different names, and different &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;.  They don&amp;rsquo;t have the same referent, and hence, they don&amp;rsquo;t have the same meaning.  Saying it like that (without the addition of surnames) is not necessarily the clearest way to say it, but if you get both of us together &amp;ndash; last done in a pub in Nottingham in October 2005 &amp;ndash; you could say exactly those words and make perfectly good, non-confusing sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you might think that the two uses of the generic name &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; are different &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; because they differ in referent, and that the only way two names of the same type could genuinely be &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; (and not one name after all) is that the case is like this &amp;ndash; that they have different referents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Kaplan, in &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; gives a delightful counterexample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about the case of the mischievous Babylonian. One evening, the mischievous Babylonian looked up and saw Venus, and he thought to himself &amp;ldquo;This one is just as beautiful as Phosphorus, so let&amp;rsquo;s call it &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo; too&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Babylonian names Venus (under the guise of the evening star) &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;in honour&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo;, the morning star, little knowing that he has re-named the one and the same planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think: later, after learning some more celestial mechanics, the astronomer can say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goodness!  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before, but now I see: &lt;em&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this can make perfect sense as something that was &lt;em&gt;discovered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that individuating names is not as easy as we might hope. Genealogy, in all is contingent glory, plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave it as an exercise to the reader to apply this to the Paderewski case.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Spandrels of Truth</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/spandrels_of_truth/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/spandrels_of_truth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Whoever thought that teaching in three subjects, chairing one committee, participating in another one with a honking big project to keep on the rails for the next few months, supervising &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; research students (for a seriously large value of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;) and trying to keep your research ticking over would keep you busy with work?  I did think that.  But now I know it by acquaintance, and not merely by dispassionate theoretical reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m not here to moan.  I&amp;rsquo;m here to make you an offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend, colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism&#34;&gt;co-author&lt;/a&gt; (more like partner in crime) &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.me.com/jcbeall/Site/Home.html&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt; has gone and written &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Spandrels of Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  (He&amp;rsquo;s one of these ridiculously prolific authors.)  Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s a cracker of a read, on the view that if we take seriously the idea that to say that &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; is true is no more and no less than to say that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then the inconsistencies like the liar paradox are side-effects of the &amp;lsquo;design&amp;rsquo; decisions, just like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel&#34;&gt;spandrels&lt;/a&gt; in architecture, and are neither to be worried about nor gotten rid of: instead, they&amp;rsquo;re to be lived with.  Jc&amp;rsquo;s job is to convince us all of this by supplying us a paraconsistent logic and enough semantic machinery to show that living with them is not going to make the whole building fall down.  I think he does a great job, and that this book is required reading for anyone thinking about theories of truth, paradoxes and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the required reading is not too expensive.  Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/temp/Spandrels.pdf&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; for your ordering, and Oxford University Press will shave 20% off the price.  Go buy it.  Help Jc rocket up the best-seller lists.  But be quick. The 20% discount lasts only until June 11, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Quiz for today</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is today&amp;rsquo;s quiz question.  Which master of exposition said &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, and where?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arguing for years, unconvincingly, that semantic value (properly understood) is not affected by substitution, I hit upon a brilliant, new, and completely successful, strategy: argue, instead, that semantic value &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; affected by substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt;: the quote occurs after in the context of a discussion of proper names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Upon reflection, that&amp;rsquo;s not much of a hint, is it?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post your guess as to who I&amp;rsquo;m quoting, in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today&#34;&gt;comments form on this post&lt;/a&gt;.  (You can post an informed answer too, if you like, but I suspect a guess would be even more fun.)  The most interesting answer will receive a &lt;em&gt;prize&lt;/em&gt; in the honest-to-goodness snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back in Melbourne.  Z and I have been back for over a week &amp;ndash; and I&amp;rsquo;ve been back at work since the middle of last week, slowly setting up while Z has been settling into school.  C returns tomorrow, and the place will feel like home at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy blogosphere is all a-flutter with the release of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/&#34;&gt;2009 Leiter Report&lt;/a&gt;.  We have known for some time that the troubles here at Melbourne &lt;a href=&#34;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/biggest-drops-in-overall-ranking-in-the-new-pgr.html&#34;&gt;would impact our rating&lt;/a&gt;  and the result is there for all to see.  We&amp;rsquo;re out of the top ranking in Australia, sinking below Monash in the report&amp;rsquo;s league tables.  Still, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to recognise that in the discipline rankings we&amp;rsquo;re notable in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown12.asp&#34;&gt;Applied Ethics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown30.asp&#34;&gt;Feminist Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown30.asp&#34;&gt;Mathematical Logic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown19.asp&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown5.asp&#34;&gt;Philosophical Logic&lt;/a&gt;.  For a very small core of a department, we do rather well.  We have a very nice group from which to rebuild a decent department &amp;ndash; the trick will be managing the rebuilding phase.  Please wish us luck (or if you can, lend us your support).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip was wonderful.  I needed the break, and I enjoyed visting Pitt, CMU and UConn (thanks Shawn, Anil, Bob, Nuel, Kevin, Steve, Kohei, Horacio, Jc, Katrina, Marcus, Aaron, Colin, Reed, Michael, Scott, and everyone else, for your hospitality), and we had much fun at each stop on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, I&amp;rsquo;m back in the saddle, confronted with a heavy class load &amp;ndash; comprising &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/800-123&#34;&gt;first-year logic&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-241&#34;&gt;upper-level logic subject&lt;/a&gt; I affectionately call &amp;ldquo;Kurt G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Hits&amp;rdquo;, and four classes in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-434&#34;&gt;fourth-year seminar on Epistemology and Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about recent work on truthmaking, from Lowe and Rami&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/1844651452/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;handy new collection&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; as well as some new postgraduate students (hi, Simon, hi Aaron!), significant administrative repsonsibilities, and writing and editing tasks I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep on the boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, work is busy.  If you&amp;rsquo;re waiting on an email from me, hold on. I&amp;rsquo;m getting to it.  I&amp;rsquo;m knocking the pile down each day, and at the moment, the pile is getting smaller, rather than bigger, so you can expect that I&amp;rsquo;ll get to yours at some time in the finite future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holiday, in progress</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re having a wonderful time on our holiday, cruising through the southwest of the USA.  The sights have been spectacular, varied and unexpected.   The highlight so far was Bryce Canyon.  The Grand Canyon is grand, and sublime in its own way.  Bryce Canyon was totally unexpected: I had no idea erosion could do just &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042/P1010494&amp;amp;bgcolor=black&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Z ran around like a madman enjoying the snow, and the awesome view.  But the highlight for Z has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042/P1010250&amp;amp;bgcolor=black&#34;&gt;throwing snowballs&lt;/a&gt;, something doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature in the average Melbourne kid&amp;rsquo;s average day.  Bigger photos, for those who want to keep up, are accumulating in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042&#34;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Zion National Park, we&amp;rsquo;re off to Las Vegas.  There, we&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to meeting &lt;a href=&#34;http://obscureandconfused.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Frost-Arnold&lt;/a&gt; in our couple of days there.  (As well as the sensory overload of the Strip, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Little Snippets of News</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here are some random, miscellaneous items of news, concerning what&amp;rsquo;s been happening around here, around now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting, but lots of fun, to host visitors.  Since just before Christmas, we&amp;rsquo;ve had visits from two good friends (separately) and four family members (one batch of three and one solo), as well as meals with other friends over the Christmas/Summer period.  Much fun was had by all.  It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to share good experiences in Melbourne with family and friends.  Highlights have included Day 2 of the Boxing Day test, &lt;a href=&#34;http://shanewarnethemusical.com.au/&#34;&gt;Shane Warne: the musical&lt;/a&gt;, and an evening watching (or re-watching) the &lt;em&gt;Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt; and singing along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally redesigned the site in a way I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see and to use.  &lt;em&gt;Again&lt;/em&gt;.  There are two causes, one proximate, and one more long-term.  The proximate cause was the superabundance of spam to moderate, on my own &lt;a href=&#34;http://segpub.com.au&#34;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;.  Logging in and cleaning out spam, arriving at the rate of at least one a minute, was depressing.  So no more hosted weblog software for me.  Instead, this site is now hand crafted on my computer (using &lt;a href=&#34;http://webby.rubyforge.org&#34;&gt;Webby&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s been fun to learn &lt;a href=&#34;http://ruby-lang.org&#34;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;) and uploaded to the server as a static site.  When I want comments on an item, I can implement them using &lt;a href=&#34;http://intensedebate.com&#34;&gt;intense debate&lt;/a&gt; or some other commenting service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more long-term aim of the redesign was to make the information here more accessible.  In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make it easier to browse my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/writing/topics&#34;&gt;papers, categorised by topic&lt;/a&gt; and these &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/&#34;&gt;news items&lt;/a&gt;.  Each news item &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/&#34;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; carry with themselves links to other news items from the same year.  It was dead-simple to code up the scripts to do this, and I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it makes browsing around the past of this weblog a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments haven&amp;rsquo;t been transferred from the old site, yet, but they&amp;rsquo;re on my list of things to do.   I hope you like the new site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hard year at work, as I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/03/30/were_in_the_news/&#34;&gt;hinted at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.  There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot more going on than that going on. My leave over this summer break has been more than welcome.  I&amp;rsquo;m away from the office for an extended period (for two weeks already, and I return only on February 23).  For some of this leave, starting tomorrow, we&amp;rsquo;re going on a trip to the US, to get away from it all.  The fact that we get to be there during Obama&amp;rsquo;s inauguration is a bonus!  More on the trip, in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Holiday!</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going on a &lt;em&gt;holiday&lt;/em&gt;! Tomorrow at noon, we&amp;rsquo;ll be on a Qantas 747 to LA, and at the other end, the three of us will be enjoying four weeks of break.  It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; time off for all of us, with a few detours for work talks for me (at Pitt, and at UConn) and for Christine (at Harvard, San Diego, Berkeley and maybe Stanford).  It&amp;rsquo;s our &amp;lsquo;consolation tour&amp;rsquo; in place of what was our original plan: a year in the USA, based in Pittsburgh.  That fell through&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s a complicated story, all to do with Melbourne, nothing to do with &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitt.edu/~philosop&#34;&gt;Pitt&lt;/a&gt;, where people have been generous, understanding and gracious.  Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m not visiting Pitt for a year, but we&amp;rsquo;re touring the US, having a break, seeing the sights (like the Grand Canyon, Death Valley, and Las Vegas) and visiting friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Pittsburgh, I&amp;rsquo;ll finally get to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://indexical.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Shawn&lt;/a&gt; whose blog I&amp;rsquo;ve read for ages, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~philosop/people/gupta.html&#34;&gt;Anil&lt;/a&gt;, whose work I&amp;rsquo;ve read and learned from for much longer.   At UConn, I&amp;rsquo;ll catch up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.me.com/jcbeall/&#34;&gt;Jc&lt;/a&gt;, which is always a blast, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.uconn.edu/~mar08022/&#34;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s moved there.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also got the honour of giving the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.uconn.edu/lecture.php&#34;&gt;inaugural annual lecture&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.uconn.edu&#34;&gt;UConn Logic Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t be posting here unless I get web access, and I think that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority on the holiday.  But after I&amp;rsquo;m back in February, I expect to be posting here more often.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Merry Christmas, all</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/12/24/merry_christmas_all/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas break here, and I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break, with visits from family and friends, and then a trip to the USA for a holiday (and for a couple of little side trips to see friends and give a few talks).  More about that in a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To share the Christmas spirit, I&amp;rsquo;ll share a favourite carol:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tree of life my soul hath seen,&lt;br /&gt;
Laden with fruit and always green:&lt;br /&gt;
The trees of nature fruitless be&lt;br /&gt;
Compared with Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His beauty doth all things excel:&lt;br /&gt;
By faith I know, but ne&amp;rsquo;er can tell&lt;br /&gt;
The glory which I now can see&lt;br /&gt;
In Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For happiness I long have sought,&lt;br /&gt;
And pleasure dearly I have bought:&lt;br /&gt;
I missed of all; but now I see&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;rsquo;Tis found in Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m weary with my former toil,&lt;br /&gt;
Here I will sit and rest awhile:&lt;br /&gt;
Under the shadow I will be,&lt;br /&gt;
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fruit doth make my soul to thrive,&lt;br /&gt;
It keeps my dying faith alive;&lt;br /&gt;
Which makes my soul in haste to be&lt;br /&gt;
With Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is to reboot the blog (and to fix the comment system, which is down for the count just now) for 2009.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see how we go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Always More...</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/12/09/always_more/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;(What follows is a bundle of ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write up for some time.  Instead of making it a fully fledged paper, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to rough it out first as a blog post.  If anything comes of it, I&amp;rsquo;ll polish it up.  Let me know what you think.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any possible worlds?  The idea of a &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; in logical space &amp;ndash; at which every proposition is either True or False &amp;ndash; seems at the one and the same time compelling and repellant.  The notion plays a vital role in the semantics of logics of modality and conditionality, and so, is compelling.  It is hard to take modal logic seriously without points in models that play the role of deciding every statement one way other the other.  But to take possible worlds seriously as more than a useful fiction has seemed too great a price for many to pay.  This squeamishness seems, to many, to have a distinctly &amp;lsquo;ontological&amp;rsquo; flavour.  Places at which there are blue swans or in which kangaroos have no tails seems to crowd the halls of being with blue swans and tailless kangaroos.  We would do better without such things if we can.   If we can explain possible worlds away &amp;ndash; as propositions, or stories or abstracta or something else relatively tame &amp;ndash; then we should.  But ontological squeamishness is not my complaint about non-actual possible worlds.  Instead of their non-actuality, my worry about possible worlds is their &lt;em&gt;worldishness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I worry about the way that these infinitely precise &lt;em&gt;points&lt;/em&gt; are then put to use in semantics.  Given that worlds are Deciders of Every Proposition, does it make sense to then turn around and think of a proposition as an arbitrary set of worlds: to think of any set of worlds as the kind of thing that can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a proposition? (David Lewis&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=mdVur1qVLr8C&#34;&gt;On the Plurality of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Chapter 1) is a very good defence of this position, but it is not just his. The view is everywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll use this post to explain why this might not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grant you: worldlike entities are rife in the study of logics.  Tarski&amp;rsquo;s models for the first-order predicate logic decide every statement in the language as either true or false.  A model is worldlike because it provides consistent and complete scenario, down to the finest detail the language can muster.  It seems inherent in the very notion of classical logic, with its two valued semantics.  Since every statement is either true or false, a world is exactly the kind of think we seem to be talking about when we use some arrangement of truth values consistent with the rules of the logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe this is not how we need to think about things: consider the case of classical propositional logic, and think back to how you were taught truth tables.  To show that &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is a tautology, you showed that it received the value &lt;em&gt;True&lt;/em&gt; in every row of a truth table.  Now, how many rows did you use? Hopefully, &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt;, one for each different possible assignment of &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; to the sentence letters &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  Any fewer than four rows would have left out some possibilities you should have checked, and any more than four rows would have been more than you needed to look at.  The truth or falsity of &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; depends only on the truth or falsity of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, and not on the Values of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; or any other sentence letter.  You check the value of your sentence not at a &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;, but at a row of a truth table which is a much blunter instrument: it cares not about most of the sentences in the language.  It knows just enough to decide the truth of the sentences in its remit, in this case, sentences formed out of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, so for every sentence.  Assuming that the stock of sentence letters is boundless (say, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;) &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; sentence will exhaust the vocabulary.  Each sentence can be decided by a row of a truth table, and no (finite) truth table will decide every sentence.  Each sentence in the vocabulary of propositional logic is finite, and so, no matter how long it goes on, there is always more vocabulary left to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can formalise this. For any sentence &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, let #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; be the first sentence letter not included in &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  So, #(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; &amp;not;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; are related in interesting ways.  In particular, if you can show that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any row of a truth table where #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true is one where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true too, then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.  Why?  Since #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is a sentence letter not occurring in &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, the absence of a row in which &lt;em&gt;#A&lt;/em&gt; is true and &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; false means that there&amp;rsquo;s no row where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.  It&amp;rsquo;s a tautology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we have three more facts like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where, in general, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; holds when there is no row of a truth table where each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is true and each member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is false.   In general, if there is no row of the table where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has some value (say false) and where #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has some value (say false, also) then there is no row where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false, since the value of #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is completely independent from the value of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;?  It encodes the idea of indefinite extensibility: no matter what our sentence says, there is always something more to say.  (Call these four conditions the &lt;em&gt;rules of extensibility&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;, then if there are possible worlds, not every set of possible worlds counts as a proposition.   Here is why.  Take the set &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; of possible worlds, and take a particular world &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;.  If {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is a proposition, what about #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;}?  Since {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} isn&amp;rsquo;t contradictory (it&amp;rsquo;s true &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, namely, at &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;), we don&amp;rsquo;t have {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} &amp;#x22A6; #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;}, and similarly, we don&amp;rsquo;t have #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;},{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} &amp;#x22A6;.  In other words, we need somewhere that {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is true and #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} isn&amp;rsquo;t, and we need somwhere that {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} and #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} are both true.  That&amp;rsquo;s impossible.  There&amp;rsquo;s only one place {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is true, namely &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if singletons of worlds are propositions, then there is no operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;. (There is a dual argument concerning complement propositions, which are true at every world except for one.  They cause just as much havoc to &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have indefinite extensibility for propositions, then no statement can single out a world, for that would be a &amp;ldquo;final proposition&amp;rdquo; for which no extensibility is possible.  If for every proposition &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; we can find some proposition #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; independent of it, possible worlds are always idealisations, out of reach of a proposition.  We can always &lt;em&gt;approximate&lt;/em&gt; worlds relative to a given vocabulary, but if vocabularies an be extended, what we take to be a world is really a collection of worlds, to be further subdivided as new vocabulary is added.  If &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is an operator, not all set of &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; (those infinitely precise &amp;ldquo;Deciders of Every Proposition&amp;rdquo;) count as a proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that would be all well and good, if there were an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;.  Is there any operator like it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not: the first problem is that &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; as it stands is not really an operator or a connective like &amp;lsquo;&amp;not;&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;and;&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;or;&amp;rsquo;, since #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; depends on how &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is presented.  For example, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and #(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) should be &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could smooth this wrinkle by defining &amp;lsquo;#&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; to be not the first sentence letter not occuring in &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but rather, the first sentence letter not occuring in any sentence &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  In that case, if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is equivalent to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, so that is better.  But now the question must remain: if &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is a genuine operator we can nest it: what is ##&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;? It is the first sentence letter not occurring in anything equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.   Consider ##&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  The first sentence letter not occuring in anything equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is, of course, p&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, since #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to itself, and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur in #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  But on the other hand, #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so ##&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; should really be &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; itself!  Perhaps &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; works as a way to transform sentences into other sentences, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thought of as an operator like the logical connectives.  Maybe it cannot be coherently defined in such a way to satisfy the four rules of extensibility.  Maybe there is no threat to propositions as arbitrary sets of infinitely precise worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem like that, but to conclude that there is no &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; would be wrong.  Although the definition of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; in terms of sentence letters is dubious, and does not give rise to a coherent operator when we attempt to nest it, it turns out that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; model a connective satisfying the rules of extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think in terms of worlds, to start.  Take the set &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; as the irrational numbers in the Real Line.  The propositions at &lt;em&gt;Level n&lt;/em&gt;  are the unions of the any selection of irrational intervals of length &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) where &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; is an integer.  These are closed under union (the union of any collections of intervals is a collection of intervals), intersection (there is no worry about endpoints of abutting intervals, as these don&amp;rsquo;t reach their endpoints, which are rational) and complement (the complement of some collection of intervals is the collection of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; intervals: since the endpoints are rational, they don&amp;rsquo;t occur in either a set or its complement).  The propositions at each level are &lt;em&gt;finer&lt;/em&gt; classifications of points than at any of the previous level.  Propositions at Level 0 are collections of intervals such as (-2,-1), (0,1), (3,4), etc.  Propositions at Level 1 are collections of &lt;em&gt;finer&lt;/em&gt; intervals (-1.5,-1), (1.5,2), (3,3.5), etc., and so on&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s interpret sentences in the language of propositional logic &amp;ndash; enhanced with the operator &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; as propositions at &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; level or other.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are interpreted as propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, then &amp;not;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;and;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;or;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are also interpreted as propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, since the union, intersection or complement of propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; are also at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To interpret #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is interpreted as a proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, we will choose a proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1.  In particular, we will choose an &lt;em&gt;alternating&lt;/em&gt; proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1: the proposition consisting of all of the intervals (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) where &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; is even integer.  The alternating proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; (-4,-3) &amp;cup; (-2,-1) &amp;cup; (0,1) &amp;cup; (2,3) &amp;cup; (4,5) &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the alternating proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; (-2,-1.5) &amp;cup; (-1,-0.5) &amp;cup; (0,0.5) &amp;cup; (1,1.5) &amp;cup; (2,2.5) &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so on.  It turns out that this choice for #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; satisfies the four rules of extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; be interpreted as a proposition at level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true everywhere, then it is false at some interval (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  Now consider #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  It is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; at  (2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true.  And #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not true&lt;/em&gt; at ((2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+2)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true.  Similarly, if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not false everywhere, it is true at some interval (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; at  (2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true.  And #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not true&lt;/em&gt; at ((2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+2)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true.  In other words, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is truly independent of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true somewhere, at some such places, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true, and at others, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false somewhere, at some such places, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true, and at others, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is completely general.  We for any proposition &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; we have found another proposition #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is more finely grained than &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, and the four rules of extensibility are satisfied.  In models like these, it makes sense to think of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; as an operator on propositions, and not merely a syntactic device for constructing sentences from other sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal to worlds in these models is not essential:  we refrain from all talk of worlds and appeal instead to &lt;em&gt;regions&lt;/em&gt; in a formal topological space.  The definition of propositions in terms of sets of points &amp;ndash; irrational numbers in our case &amp;ndash; is not essential.  The construction gives us an atomless boolean algebra, and these are well known algebraic structures.  The value of the relatively concrete construction here is the manner in which extensibility corresponds to propositions being more and more finely grained, without that ever coming to an end.  The model shows that the idea of indefinite extensibility of propositions is coherent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot tell if there are there any possible worlds, and if there are, if arbitrary sets of them count as propositions.   What I can say, however, is that if there is indefinite extensibility, such as expressed by &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; and the logic of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is coherent &amp;ndash; then not all sets of worlds are propositions.  For any proposition, there is always more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Thanks to Lloyd Humberstone, who got me first thinking about #, at a Melbourne Logic Seminar in 2006.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are, of course, most welcome.  Is this crazy?  Sensible?  Anodyne?  Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Paper: Assertion, Denial and Non-Classical Theories</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/12/04/new_paper_assertion_denial_and_nonclassical_theories/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/12/04/new_paper_assertion_denial_and_nonclassical_theories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on a roll with the writing: I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get another paper converted from slides-from-a-talk to real, live, words on a page and actual &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;.  The paper I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the last couple of days is from my presentation from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;WCP4&lt;/a&gt; on non-classical theories like non-classical theories of numbers, classes, or truth.  I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with this one, as it&amp;rsquo;s an application of my recent work &amp;ndash; on proof theory &amp;ndash; to a topic I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;for some time&lt;/a&gt;, non-classical theories like na&amp;iuml;ve theories of classes or of truth.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper I urge friends of truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts &amp;ndash; proponents of paracomplete and paraconsistent logics &amp;ndash; to consider theories not merely as sets of sentences, but as &lt;em&gt;pairs&lt;/em&gt; of sets of sentences, or what I call &amp;lsquo;bitheories,&amp;rsquo; which keep track not only of what &lt;em&gt;holds&lt;/em&gt; according to the theory, but also what &lt;em&gt;fails&lt;/em&gt; to hold according to the theory.  I explain the connection between bitheories, sequents, and the speech acts of assertion and denial. I illustrate the usefulness of bitheories by showing how they make available a technique for characterising different theories while abstracting away from logical vocabulary such as connectives or quantifiers, thereby making theoretical commitments independent of the choice of this or that particular non-classical logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples discussed include theories of numbers, classes and truth.  In the latter two cases, the bitheoretical perspective brings to light some heretofore unconsidered puzzles for friends of na&amp;iuml;ve theories of classes and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is a turnabout for me. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a slow turn for some time, from being a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;friend of na&amp;iuml;ve set theory in paraconsistent logics&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/dlpsr/&#34;&gt;friend of truth-value gaps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics&#34;&gt;over gluts&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/costing/&#34;&gt;friendly critic of non-classical approaches to things like Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;.  In this paper, I present what I take to be much more problematic paradoxes around Frege&amp;rsquo;s Law (V), for which connectives like negation and the conditional do not feature at all, so questions of the design of the non-classical logic of negation or of the conditional are beside the point when it comes to the paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d very much appreciate feedback on this paper.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this sort of thing, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/adnct.pdf&#34;&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;post your comments on the paper&amp;rsquo;s page, over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Paper: Truth Values and Proof Theory</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/12/02/new_paper_truth_values_and_proof_theory/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/12/02/new_paper_truth_values_and_proof_theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to get back into writing.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;Truth Values and Proof Theory&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long time.  I presented a research seminar on this material last year &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s taken me this long to write it up, due to other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper I present an account of truth values for classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and the modal logic S5, in which truth values are not a fundamental category from which the logic is defined, but rather, feature as an idealisation of more fundamental logical features arising out of the proof theory for each system.  The result is not a new set of semantic structures, but a new understanding of how the existing semantic structures may be understood in terms of a more fundamental notion of logical consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like these results, as they&amp;rsquo;re a mix of motivating philosophy, and formal proofs.  I think I&amp;rsquo;m getting a better understanding of the relationship between the [&lt;em&gt;Cut&lt;/em&gt;] rule in a sequent calculus and the &lt;em&gt;maximality&lt;/em&gt; conditions involved in the behaviour of things like two-valued evaluations, possible worlds and points in model structures for other sorts of logics.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a coincidence that sequents have two sides, and that there are two truth values.   I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve plumbed the depth of the connections between proof theory and model theory, but at the very least in writing this paper up I&amp;rsquo;ve got a better idea of some of the interesting questions around this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of those &amp;lsquo;bonus&amp;rsquo; results that I&amp;rsquo;ve got out of this research a uniform way of proving completeness for classical logic, Kripke and Beth models for intuitionistic logic, and universal models for S5, all with exactly the same sort of structure.  That was a surprise to me when I saw those results just fall out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments on the paper, of course, are welcome.  Don&amp;rsquo;t comment on it here, but on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;paper page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got to figure out how to massage these results into &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ptp/&#34;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;.  (It&amp;rsquo;s a pity my backlog of other writing-up tasks is so long, but that seems to be the natural state of the academic these days.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My trip to Guangzhou was super.  Thanks, Guoxin, Min and Xuefeng for looking after me and showing me the sights of Guangzhou, and to Professors Ju and Zhu for the invitation.  It was a wonderful experience for me, and I look forward to many more visits to China, and to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;Institute of Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been off to Canberra for a little workshop on hyperintensionality, organised by David Chalmers.  Much fun was had there, too, but I must admit I&amp;rsquo;m even more confused than I was when I started.  It must have been all that talking to Max Cresswell, Lloyd Humberstone and John Bigelow about how semantics works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of this site seems to be travel announcements, so rather than break the trend, I&amp;rsquo;ll post another travel announcement. On Sunday, I&amp;rsquo;m off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;Institute of Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.html&#34;&gt;Sun Yat-Sen University&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/Article/xueshuxinxi/jididongtai/200811/681.html&#34;&gt;give three lectures on my research&lt;/a&gt;.  This is my first trip to China, so I&amp;rsquo;m more excited (and more nervous) than usual for an overseas trip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Days #3 and #4</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/09/01/tartu_pluralism_days_3_and_4/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phew&lt;/em&gt;! What a long rest-of-the conference!  I&amp;rsquo;m now back in Tallinn, after the rest of the conference: 5 talks on Day 3, and one wrapup talk on Day 4.  My comments concerning Days 3 and 4 will not be as extensive as those for Days 1 and 2.  I liked these as much as the earlier talks &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just that my stamina has flagged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day kicked off with &lt;em&gt;Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f&lt;/em&gt; presenting &amp;lsquo;Is Logic about Consequence?&amp;rsquo;  I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed finally getting the opportunity to hear Per speak, as his view of logical consequence &amp;ndash; a particular constructive type theory in which proof objects play a central role &amp;ndash; has always fascinated me, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not looked into it in any depth.  Per argued that logic is not primarily about consequence, but must be also about the act of inference, and that distinguishing content and force in the judgement helps us understand the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is clearly right, and in my work since the &lt;em&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/em&gt; book I&amp;rsquo;ve started to attend to these issues.  In &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; I attended to the connection between valid sequents and the acts of assertion and denial.    While the account I give there is not one that Per would endorse, the constellation of issues connecting content and force, and the correctness of the steps we make in inferring conclusions from premises, are certainly in the domain of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we had &lt;em&gt;Dag Westerst&amp;aring;hl&lt;/em&gt; with &amp;lsquo;Sources of Plurality.&amp;rsquo;  In this talk, Dag started off with our analysis of logical consequence as truth preservation in cases &amp;ndash; and distinguished this from interpretational accounts, in which it is &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; that counts, not hypothetical truth-in-some-case.  Consequence differs from &lt;em&gt;material&lt;/em&gt; consequence by the choice of logical vocabulary to keep fixed, and to vary the other vocabulary arbitrarily.  Varying the choice of vocabulary gives you a range of different consequence relations. Dag had interesting results showing how to construct the vocabulary from the consequence relation rather than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we had &lt;em&gt;Agust&amp;iacute;n Rayo&lt;/em&gt; working &amp;lsquo;Towards a Trivialist Account of Logic.&amp;rsquo; This wasn&amp;rsquo;t really about &lt;em&gt;pluralism&lt;/em&gt; as such, but rather, was about one sort of account of logical truths as statements which are, in a certain sense, &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt;, those statements whose denial is &lt;em&gt;unintelligible&lt;/em&gt;.  Agust&amp;iacute;n connected the notion of intelligibility with identity (he argued that if you take &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; to be identical to &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, then the &lt;em&gt;de re&lt;/em&gt; consideration of a case where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; will strictly speaking be unintelligible) with modality (understood as truth in all intelligible scenarios) and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting trinity of considerations, and most interesting for me was the methodological points Agust&amp;iacute;n made about the kinds of &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; we have in forming vocabulary.  The more identities we endorse, then the more scenarios become unintelligible, and the more &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; questions we cannot answer.  (According to Agust&amp;iacute;n there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; answer to the question of why water is H2O, or why Hesperus is Phosphorous.)  On the other hand, the more identities we endorse, the more consequences are derivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agust&amp;iacute;n was followed by &lt;em&gt;Marcus Rossberg&lt;/em&gt;  with &amp;lsquo;Pluralism about Logic Proper,&amp;rsquo; in which Marcus wanted to reconcile a Fregean view taking the topic-neutrality of logic seriously, with the pluralist sympathies of Carnap.  Marcus developed the idea of a &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;, for which different logics may be appropriate (say, constructive mathematics; quantum objects; etc.) and attempted to reconcile pluralism with a proper &amp;lsquo;lower limit&amp;rsquo; logic which is most general and applicable for all topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 3 was wrapped up by &lt;em&gt;Dag Prawitz&lt;/em&gt; who presented &amp;lsquo;Kinds of Pluralism in Logic&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dag&amp;rsquo;s talk started off with an excellent summary of the kind of logical pluralism favoured by JC and me, and then he proceeded to inquire about what logic ought to say about an inference: a transition to a conclusion &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; from premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;, etc. He did not think that either of the claims made in the book &amp;ndash; (1) that if an argument is invalid then the inference from premises to conclusion makes a mistake or (2) that if an argument is valid, then it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to assert the premises and deny the conclusion &amp;ndash; sufficed to give an account of what is going on.  Dag&amp;rsquo;s preferred story is that valid arguments provide a way to transform the grounds of the premises into a ground for the conclusion, and that if an argument is &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; to be valid, then the infer-er can use the argument to supply the ground for the conclusion of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about this view, I think.  It has an account of where the difference lies in knowing that an argument is valid, by showing that this gives you a means to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; from the premises to the conclusion, and there are very well developed theory of proofs (say, Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f&amp;rsquo;s proof objects or realisability semantics, or some other theory) which can give us accounts of the structures of such grounds and the way we can manipulate them (by taking them &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; in pairs; by &lt;em&gt;applying&lt;/em&gt; one to another in &lt;em&gt;modus ponens&lt;/em&gt;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dag thought that this removed the need/desire for plurality, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about this.  It seems to me that you could accept this, and think that there was a plurality, say, between deductive conseqence and formal consequence; and between classical formal consequence and intuitionist formal consequence; and perhaps also into relevant consequence &amp;mdash; if one had different accounts of what were allowable techniques for transforming one ground into another.  Mathematical reasoning, for example, uses &lt;em&gt;recursion&lt;/em&gt; as a technique for constructing a new ground out of old grounds, and this does not play a role in purely formal logical consequence. You might also say that classical reasoning uses a technique for constructing grounds (continuations, in the double-negation translation, or something more complicated with positive and negative &amp;lsquo;grounds&amp;rsquo; in a symmetric proof system) that are not permitted with intuitionist ground-formation.  The pluralist view of the move from premise to conclusion remains, but translated here into a very different key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s lots more to think about here, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to attempting to work some of it out, to see if the sketches I&amp;rsquo;m making here actually bear fruit.  If you do any thinking on these issues &amp;ndash; and get anywhere with them &amp;ndash; please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on Sunday, we wrapped up with one talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;JC Beall&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;lsquo;Logical Pluralism, Validity and Truth-Preservation.&amp;rsquo; Here, JC brought together his interest in the paradoxes and the logical pluralism with the negative result to the effect that truth-in-a-case can&amp;rsquo;t be identified with truth (in the actual world) for Curry-paradoxical reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I think about this &amp;ndash; primarily because I don&amp;rsquo;t really have settled ideas of what to think about truth.  It did convince me that it&amp;rsquo;s important to sort this out and be clear on the nature and properties of truth and its connections with logical consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was it!  It was a wonderful conference &amp;ndash; Daniel, Marcus and Peter did a wonderful job organising, and we all enjoyed ourselves immensely.  It was good to catch up with old friends and to make new ones.  I&amp;rsquo;ve left with lots more things to think about, and some new ways to do that thinking.  You can&amp;rsquo;t ask for anything more from a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this final report late in the evening in Tallinn.  Tomorrow I take the long journey back to Melbourne, via Amsterdam and Singapore.  Hopefully these conference reports have been useful if you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to come to the conference.  Writing them helped me collect my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Day #2</title>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/29/tartu_pluralism_day_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;OK, it&amp;rsquo;s a short day here today &amp;ndash; thankfully, since I&amp;rsquo;m knackered after Day #1 &amp;ndash; with two talks.  Last night we dined at an Italian Restaurant, and I learned more about &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dutilh/articles/swyneshed.pdf&#34;&gt;Roger Swyneshed&lt;/a&gt; from Stephen Read, than I ever expected to learn.  Talks today are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm&#34;&gt;Peter Pagin&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;em&gt;Universalist and Actualist Consequence&lt;/em&gt;.  Peter connected his work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~kgl/kathrin.htm&#34;&gt;Kathrin Gl&amp;uuml;er&lt;/a&gt; on relational modality and the semantics of names with considerations concerning the difference between universal validity (truth in all possible worlds whatsoever) and actualist validity (truth in all candidate actual worlds &amp;ndash; down the diagonal in a 2D semantics, for example). He indicated that his looks like our distinction, both should count as validity notions which ought to be endorsed.  Peter wondered whether this was a problem, and whether there&amp;rsquo;s a conflict between endorsing universalist validity and actualist validity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good question: I think that this is a good case where being a pluralist makes sense: if we think of validity as classifying deduction steps into those that are valid and those that aren&amp;rsquo;t, then actualist and universalist validity notions have their place.  Take the step from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;.  This is OK in one obvious sense (we&amp;rsquo;d make a mistake to assert &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and deny &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;), and bad in another (that step doesn&amp;rsquo;t work if we are under a counterfactual assumption &amp;ndash; we grant that &lt;em&gt;not p&lt;/em&gt;, and then consider what would have happened were &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; the case &amp;ndash; we can&amp;rsquo;t infer from that to &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More must be done, of course, on what it is to &lt;em&gt;endorse&lt;/em&gt; the logic, and to say why we might like to have both of these criteria in our toolkit.  I think we do want both, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think that arguing abou which of these is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;deductive validity&amp;rsquo; is fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next talk is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johan van Benthem, for whom &lt;em&gt;Logical Pluralism Meets Logical Dynamics&lt;/em&gt;.  Johan kicked off by addressing the issue of what logic &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, noting that &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;computation&lt;/em&gt;, which are equally important.  Logical systems are neat&amp;ndash;they do all these things.  In the talk, rich with different ideas, the focus was on the &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; treatment of logic, of proof and deduction.  The thought is simple, but the consequences are rich: thinking of announcements as acts in which the space of possibilities is narrowed down, we can think of the argument from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; when after announcing &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; (in that order), the announcement that &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; would be redundant.  The neat thing here is that Knower-paradoxical announcements (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; but you don&amp;rsquo;t know that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) have interesting logical properties such that announcing them &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; has a different effect than announcing them once.  There are clearly different notions of information processing and deduction in play here, and as always, Johan&amp;rsquo;s work is rich with ideas and consequences for many people to work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very glad that the paper this talk was based on will be appearing in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;AJL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, with commentaries by others, too.  So hopefully, that will bring the dynamic epistemic approach into conversation with other traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after lunch, we&amp;rsquo;re off to &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=estonia&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=58.525257,27.498779&amp;amp;spn=1.827038,3.339844&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=8&#34;&gt;the lake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Day #1</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/28/tartu_pluralism_day_1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2008 23:57:40 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/28/tartu_pluralism_day_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re coming semi-live from Tartu, as long as my computer&amp;rsquo;s battery lasts, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For live off-the-cuff comments, try my experimental &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter stream&lt;/a&gt;, which is profoundly silly, but fun to fiddle with on my phone when my fingers are itchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lineup today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me, giving &amp;ldquo;Pluralism and Proofs.&amp;rdquo;  I think I went well.  Look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2008/08/sneak-preview-greg-restall-on-logical.html&#34;&gt;Ole&amp;rsquo;s sneak-preview of what I said&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty-well what I said here.  The fact that Dag Prawitz and Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f didn&amp;rsquo;t eat me alive, but were actually interested, was profoundly reassuring.  I&amp;rsquo;ve only done the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/pluralism_and_proofs_[slides].pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, not a written version of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Priest on &amp;ldquo;Logical Pluralism as another application of Chunk-and-Permeate.&amp;rdquo;  This is an interesting project, conceiving of logic&amp;rsquo;s application to a domain of reasoning as variegated &amp;ndash; a domain of discourse can be &amp;lsquo;chunked&amp;rsquo; into different bits, where different logics are operative, and then &amp;lsquo;permeation&amp;rsquo; relations tell us how facts in one chunk transfer over to facts in another.  Graham was using this general setup (which he introduced in earlier work with Bryson Brown, on the infinitesimal calculus &amp;ndash; one chunk is where the infinitesimal is zero, another chunk is where it&amp;rsquo;s nonzero, and you only permeate facts about non-infinitesimals, or something like that).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham&amp;rsquo;s take on pluralism here is that you can think of the different chunks as different kinds of things we&amp;rsquo;re reasoning about: quantum objects (with their quantum logic) and middle-sized dry goods and their non-quantum (say, classical logic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this application is really interesting, and it&amp;rsquo;s not what we (JC and I) talking about in our pluralism.  We&amp;rsquo;re pluralists about the logic used for evaluating &amp;ldquo;reasoning about&amp;rdquo; the same collections of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top question (or was it three?) came from Johan van Benthem, who pointed out the parallel with channel theory (I should have warned Graham about that because I should have spotted that!), and interesting applications in database combination, and legal reasons why information maybe shouldn&amp;rsquo;t flow from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After lunch, it&amp;rsquo;s Stephen Read and &amp;ldquo;General-Elimination Harmony and the Meaning of the Logical Constants,&amp;rdquo; which sounds like a good name for a bad cover band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was all about &lt;em&gt;general elimination harmony&lt;/em&gt;: the notion that we can take the introduction rule for a connective as defining it, and a general elimination rule (defined in a systematic way,  at least for simple cases of introduction rules) can be reconstructed out of the introduction rule if that connective is to be defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read&amp;rsquo;s favourite &amp;ldquo;connective&amp;rdquo; (in shudder quotes, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt; anything) is the bullet (or blob) &amp;ndash; &amp;bull; &amp;ndash; with the introduction rule allowing us to infer &amp;bull; from a proof from &amp;bull; to absurdity.  He showed that one could define an appropriate general elimination rule in harmony with that introduction rule.  So it&amp;rsquo;s OK in some sense &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s harmonious &amp;mdash; but not a conservative extension of the underlying pre-&amp;bull; consequence relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then went on to talk of the application of these notions to modality (which I&amp;rsquo;d heard from Stephen before in the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004787622057&#34;&gt;Harmony and Autonomy in Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;), but then he went on to talk of conditionality.  Here, the discussion took an interesting turn, for Stephen pointed out that the necessary discussion of structural rules (which came up in the discussion of conjunction, disjunction, etc).  Ringing the changes on this &amp;ndash; or at least attending to questions about contraction and weakening &amp;ndash; give us a way to understand the logical behaviour of conditionality, for the structural rules feature prominently in the behaviour of the conditional rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was fun, even more fun happened in discussion, with zingers of questions from Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f and Dag Prawitz.  Per pushed on the definition of the blob &amp;ndash; this definition literally makes no sense for Per, because for Per, you can&amp;rsquo;t prove that &amp;bull; is a proposition.  This is right, and it helped bring out the difference between Per&amp;rsquo;s constructive type theory and Stephen&amp;rsquo;s logic. Then Dag Prawitz pointed out that the choice of structural rules cannot be arbitrary, but must be constrained in some way: what is the ground for choosing one set of structural rules rather than another.  Stephen indicated that this is a really interesting question worth sorting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then next, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbph.de/&#34;&gt;Manuel Bremer&lt;/a&gt;, presenting &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbph.de/Logic/Pluralism.pdf&#34;&gt;What is Logical Pluralism?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; He argued that our logical pluralism is not clear, and if it&amp;rsquo;s clear, it&amp;rsquo;s either not true, or not interesting.  This sounds ominous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;ominous&lt;/em&gt;.  It was a lovely example of how &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; perspectives on what logic is (or does) result in making pluralism look very implausible.  Manuel&amp;rsquo;s starting point was that logic has something to do with cognitive architecture&amp;ndash;in particular, that inferences arising out of generative grammar rules&amp;ndash;are genuinely valid, and that logic deviating from that just doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a grip on &lt;em&gt;what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, I think, given the starting point, but I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with Manuel&amp;rsquo;s starting point.  This means, of course, that I should say something about the connection is between cognitive architecture and logical validity.  Yes, I should.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t said much, except to say that the connection between deductive consequence relations and the &lt;em&gt;inferences&lt;/em&gt; one does or should make are generally complicated matters, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/inference_vs_im_1.html&#34;&gt;the usual Harman-esque reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion, I must admit, got quite pointed at times, as you&amp;rsquo;d expect when people disagree about fundamental issues, and want to sort out where you disagree.  It was all in good fun, and Manuel sweetly came up to me afterwards to say &amp;ldquo;I hope you weren&amp;rsquo;t offended.&amp;rdquo;  Of course I wasn&amp;rsquo;t, and as Johan van Bentham mentioned in discussion time, Manuel lavished us with attention to bring out why so much of JC&amp;rsquo;s and my take on logical pluralism is wrong-headed from his view, and so much critical attention is &amp;ndash; indeed &amp;ndash; a form of praise.  Too right it is!  Thanks, Manuel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last up for today, Hartry Field, trying to find an &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; logical pluralism.   (The requirement for finding &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; views is a bit of a running joke here.)  I&amp;rsquo;ll write this up later when I recharge the battery on my computer.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a minute remaining on the battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m back.  Hartry&amp;rsquo;s talk featured lots of interesting concerns I can&amp;rsquo;t recount here (neither the time nor the space), but he major point for me was his connection between the notion of logical validity and constraint of degrees of belief.  Hartry argues (as he did in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures&#34;&gt;Locke lectures&lt;/a&gt;) that if one takes the inference from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; to be valid, then the degree of belief of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; should be no higher than the degree of belief of &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; (and this generalises for arguments with more premises), and that you &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; take validity to be necessary truth preservation, for this ensnares you in paradox.  Then since validity is a normative notion, and since Hartry thinks we should be anti-realists about norms, there is room for a kind of plurality here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is not much room for plurality where it&amp;rsquo;s exciting, as far as Hartry can see, since that kind of wiggle room isn&amp;rsquo;t there when it comes to truth value gaps and truth value gluts.  The disagreement between a gap view and a glut view and classical view isn&amp;rsquo;t up for pluralism on this account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s completely right, by my lights. My disagreement with Graham Priest over whether or not a liar sentence is both true and false is not up for a pluralist reconciliation.  We just disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I think there&amp;rsquo;s scope for more work is the nature of the norms, and whether or not the connection between degree-of-belief management and deductive validity is two way, or only one way.  Is an argument from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; valid (or we know it&amp;rsquo;s valid, or whaever) &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; and only if we ought regulate our degree of belief to have &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;) never over &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)?  I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s right, but making the case for this &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt; requires close attention to what an attribution of degrees of belief involves, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If this is Thursday, it must be Tartu.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; starts today, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m up first&lt;/a&gt;.  The nerves have started to jangle just a bit, since the audience is about as high-powered as any in my experience at international conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just as well as those who intimidate me the most this time around (due to their all-round awesomeness combined with the fact that this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve met them) &amp;ndash; Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f,  Dag Prawitz and Johan van Benthem &amp;ndash; are uniformly warm and personable. (I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if that will make it better or worse when the knife gets sunk in to my position.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on time, attention and lots of other factors, I&amp;rsquo;ll try blogging a bit from the conference, though I won&amp;rsquo;t promise to keep up through the entire thing.  So, if you&amp;rsquo;re here and I don&amp;rsquo;t mention &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; presentation, please don&amp;rsquo;t hold that against me.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough to keep your attention up over an entire conference, let alone write something sensible, meaningful and worth-posting-on-the-internet about each and every talk at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My talk starts in roughly three hours from now.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amsterdam!</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/24/amsterdam/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2008 23:37:56 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/24/amsterdam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in Amsterdam.  Getting here was touch-and-go.  My decent wait between my Melbourne &amp;rarr; Singapore flight and my Singapore &amp;rarr; Amsterdam leg whittled down to around 45 minutes.  That involved a trek through the terminal, a tense wait at Transfer Desk C (where people in the queue in front of me were arguing with the staff about visas, and people behind me were concerned that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get on the flight &amp;ndash; and were expressing this concern, rather vocally).  I got there in the end, but it was a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Highlight of the trip&lt;/em&gt;?  Reading 100 pages of Anil Gupta&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/019536726X&#34;&gt;Empricism and Experience&lt;/a&gt;.  This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good.  It&amp;rsquo;s (1) logically sharp, (2) applied to philosophical issues of deep concern and most interestingly (3) original and creative, and enlightening.   He cuts at deep issues with classical empiricism, at a level of abstraction that &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m convinced &amp;ndash; gets to the heart of the matter in a new and illuminating way.  Characterising classical empiricism as the result of a number of theses concerning what is given in experience (that it&amp;rsquo;s propositional, veridical, and multiply factorisable), and that this combination &amp;ndash; rather than the argument from Illusion and the debate surrounding this &amp;ndash; that dooms classical empiricism to never explain the epistemic success we have. It&amp;rsquo;s rigourous, illuminating and spot on.  (Oh, and the comments on Quine &amp;ndash; to the effect that accepts exactly the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; parts of classical empiricism, to betray naturalism for a kind of idealism &amp;ndash; alone are worth the price of admission.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now that when I grow up I want to be able to think and write like Anil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lowlight of the trip&lt;/em&gt;? Having my order for an Asian Vegetarian meal ignored by KLM at one meal.  When I mentioned to the steward that this salad didn&amp;rsquo;t look very vegetarian (with the chicken and all), &amp;ndash; and that I had ordered a vegetarian meal when I booked my flight &amp;ndash; she apologised, and got me a replacement salad.  It looked like a very odd potato salad.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t place where I&amp;rsquo;d seen potato sliced so thinly in a potato salad, but there was so much mayonnaise that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell.  What I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell, of course, was that it was a salad whose principle ingredient (well, competing with the mayonnaise) was ham.  That&amp;rsquo;s a salad that vegetarians, Muslims and Jews can all get behind!  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the flight was fine.  I use flights to sleep, read, and while having meals, catch up on my trashy movie viewing. This time, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/&#34;&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200465/&#34;&gt;The Bank Job&lt;/a&gt;.  Both were enjoyable in a throwaway sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I&amp;rsquo;ve waited at Schiphol for longer than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped to, waiting for my bag to catch up, strolled around the city, and pored over Dutch Masters at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rijksmuseum.nl&#34;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got some more exploration to do this evening, and then tomorrow too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Bag packed, ticket &amp;amp; passport at the ready, &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/macbookpro&#34;&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt; charged, &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/iphone&#34;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; charged and synced, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Colossians-Remixed-Subverting-Brian-Walsh/dp/0830827382/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/019536726X&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; located, papers to read/referee/assess all printed or downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must be going on a flight.  The trip takes me from Melbourne to Singapore to Amsterdam to Tallinn to &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;Tartu&lt;/a&gt;, and then I retrace my steps to get back here in ten days.  That&amp;rsquo;s too much plane and airport time for my money, but I fully expect that &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; will be worth the discomfort.  Oh, the day-and-a-bit stopover in Amsterdam should &lt;a href=&#34;http://rijksmuseum.nl/&#34;&gt;be worth it too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pain, stress, redundancies, another day at the office</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2008 10:35:03 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I had thought that we (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;Faculty of Arts&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;) were trying to keep our difficulties an internal affair, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/arts-renewal/workforce-proposal.html&#34;&gt;apparently we&amp;rsquo;re not&lt;/a&gt;.  Given that this is all public news, I suppose I could comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take-home-message from this memo from the Dean: (1) The budget in the Arts Faculty is not yet in the black, though it&amp;rsquo;s getting better, and (2) The plan is for more voluntary &amp;lsquo;redundancies&amp;rsquo; (this is now Round 3), this time with the shadow of involuntary redundancies is we don&amp;rsquo;t get enough voluntary ones to right the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discipline of Philosophy took an almighty hit at the end of Round 1. At the end of 2007 we had 5 departures out of a full-time teaching staff of 10.5.  So we&amp;rsquo;ve done rather more than our part of the deal in righting the budgetary situation &amp;ndash; except for the very real problem of &amp;lsquo;overcorrecting,&amp;rsquo; making it rather &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult to teach a coherent Philosophy major in the BA (with keen, bright students ready to learn), supervise our wonderful graduate students, and get research done.   There are so few philosophers left, this round of redundancies is not directed at us, but we feel for our colleagues down the corridors, and across the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future for us is murky, but at least there&amp;rsquo;s very real prospect for rebuilding once the rest of the Faculty has sorted out its bottom line.  In the near term we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; creative to get enough bodies on the ground to do our jobs well.  We&amp;rsquo;re looking at other sources of funding, grants, bringing people on research fellowships, etc.  That&amp;rsquo;s all good, but of course, what we most need is a stable core group of people to teach and research and run the place.  In this environment, with the best will in the world from colleagues, it&amp;rsquo;s still touch and go as to how we get through it.  The next few months are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather out-of-communication on the website for the last months.  Both figuring out how to we philosophers at Melbourne work through this, and managing the stress it&amp;rsquo;s been causing has been a struggle.  (Ask my long-suffering spouse and child&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Out of the five Australians who were chosen as nominating editors of this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophersannual.org/&#34;&gt;Philosophers&amp;rsquo; Annual&lt;/a&gt;, four are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;The University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  The lucky 4 are Hazen, Schroeter (Fran&amp;ccedil;ois), Schroeter (Laura), and Restall.  (The other Australian is David Chalmers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 out of 28 is a good strike rate (that&amp;rsquo;s 1 in 7, if you&amp;rsquo;re too lazy to do the mental arithmetic). This is a teensy bit higher than the representation of University of Melbourne Philosophers in the Whole Wide World.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breaking Silence</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/08/16/breaking_silence/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet here, lately.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;busy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-201&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;, getting stuff done.  I hope to be posting more soon, when various up-in-the-air things are more settled.  Still, here are some recent highlights which are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;WCP4&lt;/a&gt; was a blast.  It was very busy, but lots of fun was had: it was good to catch up with many folks I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen for ages including (&lt;a href=&#34;http://logica.rug.ac.be/~dirk/&#34;&gt;Diderik Batens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://directory.uleth.ca/research/viewperson.html?uid=brown&#34;&gt;Bryson Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unica.it/~paoli/&#34;&gt;Francesco Paoli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://olethhjortland.googlepages.com/home&#34;&gt;Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/index.cfm?S=STAFF_jsel014&#34;&gt;Jerry Seligman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~grussell/&#34;&gt;Gill Russell&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt;, who I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in an all-too-long period of time) and to make the acquaintance of new folks (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/fberto&#34;&gt;Francesco Berto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.unc.edu/ripley.html&#34;&gt;David Ripley&lt;/a&gt;, Andreas Pietz, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogandnot-blog.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ben Burgis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/index.cfm?S=STAFF_pgir999&#34;&gt;Patrick Girard&lt;/a&gt; and many others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been lots of fun to have Andi Pietz, Dave Ripley and Ole Hjortland hang out with us in Melbourne this semester.  I think they&amp;rsquo;re having fun, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun talking logic with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-201&#34;&gt;Reasoning &amp;amp; Uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; is my new level &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; undergraduate subject.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a class of 60, doing philosophy of probability, decision theory, etc., and we&amp;rsquo;re having a lot of fun.  Having students turn up to class, enthusiastic, despite 9am lectures, is something to behold.  Conrad Asmus is my tutor, and working with him makes things very easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/people/Conrad_Asmus/636311603&#34;&gt;Conrad Asmus&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; PhD student, has all-but-passed his PhD.  He has minor changes to make (which will be done within a few weeks, won&amp;rsquo;t they, Conrad?), and once they&amp;rsquo;re OKd by the local examiner, he&amp;rsquo;ll graduate. Congratulations, Conrad!  You&amp;rsquo;re my first beginning-to-end supervised graduate student, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have supervised your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Estonia in a week&amp;rsquo;s time, for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; it will be smaller, more focussed blast than WCP4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting back from Estonia, I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at a &amp;lsquo;Men&amp;rsquo;s Breakfast&amp;rsquo; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://stjohnswestbrunswick.org.au/&#34;&gt;my church&lt;/a&gt;, under the gradiose title of &amp;lsquo;From Church to the Campus and Back Again: tales from a Christian teaching Philosophy at University.&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m under instruction to be funny, serious, profound, accessible and provocative &amp;ndash; in under 20 minutes.  I&amp;rsquo;ll see how I go&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hard year here, with reduced staffing numbers in Philosophy at Melbourne.  Everyone&amp;rsquo;s working Very Hard and doing Very Good Things, but until we get new positions and More People, things are going to be a struggle.  Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll have some better news soon, so we can advertise some jobs in the next few months.  Watch this space&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logical Pluralism, in Tartu</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/04/16/logical_pluralism_in_tartu/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2008/04/16/logical_pluralism_in_tartu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Tartu in late August, for what looks like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;really fun conference&lt;/a&gt; on logical pluralism.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?speakers&#34;&gt;list of speakers&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinarily high-powered.  Having so many smart people talk about logical pluralism is exciting, and not a little bit scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in coming along, &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?register&#34;&gt;let the organisers know by July 1&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the state of the art on logical pluralism, this conference is the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de&#34;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mr30/&#34;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm&#34;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; for organising this.  It&amp;rsquo;s going to be my highlight of the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://informallogic.ca&#34;&gt;Informal Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, on argumentation theory and related issues, is now open access and online, after a 27 year history as a print (closed access) journal.    The editors have sent out a request for interested parties to subscribe.  Subscription is free: just &lt;a href=&#34;http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/user/register&#34;&gt;fill in this form on the site&lt;/a&gt;. The editors are aiming get enough subscribers to secure funding from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sshrc.ca&#34;&gt;SSHRC&lt;/a&gt; to keep the journal going now that they&amp;rsquo;re not taking paid subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a worthy goal: the more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;open access journals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://semprag.org&#34;&gt;the better&lt;/a&gt;!

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Alas, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/jobs-under-threat-at-melbourne-uni/2008/03/29/1206207499091.html&#34;&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt; for not-very-good reasons.  Given the recent retirements in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;Philosophy at Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, it would be worse than surprising if any of the new redundancies hit Philosophy.  However, the atmosphere around here not good &amp;ndash; what concerns us most is the scope for new hiring when the Faculty as a whole is in the red so much.  It is very hard to effectively plan ahead when so much is in flux and you&amp;rsquo;re not sure whether your efforts will benefit the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to find out more when we hear what the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/about/faculty/&#34;&gt;Dean&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/about/seniorexec/davis.html&#34;&gt;Vice Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; has to say at a meeting of all Arts Faculty staff this Tuesday.  Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that they can articulate something that goes beyond slashing positions to rectify a budget hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to start posting on something so grim, but &amp;ldquo;trouble at t&amp;rsquo;mill&amp;rdquo; has been on our minds since mid-2007.  I hope to post more about more enjoyable things soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, take a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing page&lt;/a&gt;. There are quite a few new items there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melbourne Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2007/08/06/melbourne_philosophy_undergraduate_workshop/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2007 11:32:02 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2007/08/06/melbourne_philosophy_undergraduate_workshop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Are you an undergraduate student in philosophy, or do you know any undergraduate philosophy students?  If so, you might be interested in the &lt;em&gt;Melbourne Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop&lt;/em&gt; to be held from September 21 to 23.   This will be a chance for Australian and New Zealand undergraduate students who are interested in philosophy, to get together to talk philosophy with the faculty here at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  Given that we have a broad range of interests, from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Ethics and Social Philosophy, Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic, this will be a fun weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for applying for a grant to come to the workshop is coming up very soon: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;August 15&lt;/strong&gt;.  For more details of how to be involved, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the weekend of September Friday 21 to Sunday 23,
Melbourne University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;School of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; will host the &lt;em&gt;Melbourne
Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop&lt;/em&gt;, aimed at
third and fourth year students who intend to continue in any branch of academic
philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday evening&lt;/em&gt; will begin with a Welcome Meeting followed by
dinner on Lygon Street, Carlton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Saturday&lt;/em&gt;, Melbourne faculty members will give presentations and/or lead seminars on a range of topics &amp;ndash; from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic. Saturday evening, another dinner on Lygon Street with more discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, each student will give a 15-or-so minute philosophy presentation, followed by 10 minutes for questions and discussion. This will continue after lunch until, satiated, we disperse to downtown Melbourne or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten particularly talented 3rd year and Honours students from across Australasia will be invited. Their transportation expenses will be covered up to $400, with a possibility of greater funds for students from Western Australia and New Zealand. Melbourne Philosophy will provide college accommodation for three nights, September 21 through 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested students should submit a transcript, along with a letter discussing their philosophical interests and, if possible, an abstract of their presentation talk. A short letter of reference from a faculty member is also required. Deadline: &lt;strong&gt;15 August 2007&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send your material to Dr. Neil Thomason at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:neilt@unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;neilt@unimelb.edu.au&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talk on the Philosopher&#39;s Zone</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2007/08/05/talk_on_the_philosophers_zone/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2007/08/05/talk_on_the_philosophers_zone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk on Logic in Australia at &lt;a href=&#34;http://arts.monash.edu.au/news-and-events/artsinaction07/program.php&#34;&gt;Monash University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Arts in Action&lt;/em&gt; festival&lt;/a&gt; in early June.  (This was a part of a long-running project on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://arts.monash.edu.au/phil/research/history/grant8.html&#34;&gt;History of Australasian Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  The talk is now appearing, in two parts, on the (wonderful) ABC Radio National program, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/&#34;&gt;The Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  The first part was broadcast this weekend, but the audio can be downloaded from their &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2007/1992998.htm&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the next four weeks.  That was the first half of the talk, on possible worlds.  The second half, on paraconsistency, will be broadcast next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I made heavy use of digital projection.  I think you can follow the talk without it, but if you want to see the pretty pictures and diagrams, you can download the slides of the talk here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>... and we&#39;re back</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2007/08/05/_and_were_back/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in Melbourne for a while.  The trip was very enjoyable, but I&amp;rsquo;ve returned to Melbourne with a chest bug, which has meant that I&amp;rsquo;m not quite up to full speed yet.  All non-essential activities (and alas, some essential ones, I fear) are progressing much more slowly than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;Logica 2007&lt;/a&gt; with so many great people, and then exploring Prague, catching up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;, and getting to know more Czech logicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overdosing on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/&#34;&gt;Medieval logic in Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, and especially talking over Bradwardine with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring K&amp;oslash;benhavn with Christine and Zachary.  It was my second visit there, and Christine&amp;rsquo;s umpteenth, so it was a lot easier to get around given than we were more familiar with the place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating our way on the trains and buses from &amp;Aring;rhus to &lt;a href=&#34;http://legoland.dk&#34;&gt;Legoland in Billund&lt;/a&gt; with Zachary, and then enjoying all there was to see and do there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting everyone at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium in Wroc&amp;#322;aw&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; and especially thinking through &amp;ndash; with Pavel Pudl&amp;aacute;k, Albert Visser, Alasdair Urquhart and Vedran &amp;#x10C;a&amp;#x10D;i&amp;#x107; &amp;ndash; a counterexample to a conjecture of Grzegorczyk&amp;rsquo;s.  The result of our thinking is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cas.cz/~pudlak/strings/doku.php?id=a_counterexample_to_a_conjecture_of_grzegorczyk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the thinking got done in a hike in the hills near Wroc&amp;#322;aw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flying back home with Z. Normally he finds the in-flight entertainment much more attractive than mundane activities such as sleep.  This can sometimes cause difficulty, especially when flying in to an airport for a quick change of planes, and we have a tired unhappy boy to navigate through the system.  This time, however, he slept well on both flights (Frankfurt to Singapore and Singapore to Melbourne), and we managed to get back home with very little jetlag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a good time was had by all.  It&amp;rsquo;s good to be back, even if we have to struggle through a bit more of winter here.  At least &lt;a href=&#34;http://lions.com.au&#34;&gt;our AFL team&lt;/a&gt; is performing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-pile-on-the-pressure-in-finals-bid/2007/08/04/1185648222098.html&#34;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-in-flagcontender-form-matthews/2007/07/30/1185647829342.html&#34;&gt;than&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/rfmatchreport/pies-have-no-answers-against-roaring-lions/2007/07/28/1185339332180.html&#34;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt;, so we might be able to cope with the end of the season here in football-mad Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in a sunny and summery Prague.  The locals tell me they it&amp;rsquo;s cooler than the unseasonably warm that it&amp;rsquo;s been in the last few years, but it seems nicely summery for one who has come from a winter.  I&amp;rsquo;m now chatting in the office with &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=801&#34;&gt;Timothy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jarda.peregrin.cz/welcome.htm&#34;&gt;Jarda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=798&#34;&gt;Vladimir&lt;/a&gt;, and monopolising Jarda&amp;rsquo;s computer while the others do work preparing for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m waiting in Gate 9 at the international terminal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne-airport.com.au/&#34;&gt;Melbourne Airport&lt;/a&gt;, getting ready to board my first flight on my trip to Europe.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a short hop &amp;ndash; Singapore/Frankfurt/Prague, but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcdo.cz/&#34;&gt;very nice place&lt;/a&gt; for what to all appearances will be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;very enjoyable conference&lt;/a&gt;.  From then, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/&#34;&gt;Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, and then Denmark (K&amp;oslash;benhavn, and &amp;Aring;rhus) to meet up with Christine and Zachary, to have a little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.legoland.dk&#34;&gt;holiday&lt;/a&gt; while Christine does some work.  On the way out, it&amp;rsquo;s Wroc&amp;#322;aw, where I&amp;rsquo;ll play a little part in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html&#34;&gt;big conference&lt;/a&gt; before heading home with Zachary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, let me know if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be around anywhere in the vicinity during this European trip.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be catching up with some mates, but it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to meet more friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I owe you an email, that&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been ridiculously busy preparing for this trip, teaching courses, looking after the boy, etc&amp;hellip; But I&amp;rsquo;m ploughing through my backlog, and I might &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; get there in the next few weeks.  One can hope!)&lt;/p&gt;

What we mistakenly called &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg&#34;&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; are actually &lt;em&gt;finials&lt;/em&gt;. (I&amp;rsquo;ve corrected the caption on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg&#34;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; in case you don&amp;rsquo;t understand what Christine meant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine took that photo on a finial-photographing expedition with Zachary and a friend from his class in school, on Zachary&amp;rsquo;s birthday a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2002/05/14/job_at_auckland/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, logic jobs in Philosophy Departments are pretty rare.  Well, as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2007/04/logic-job-at-auckland-nz.html&#34;&gt;Richard mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s a logic job in Philosophy at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/departments/index.cfm?S=D_PHIL&#34;&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;.  A little bird has told me that even though the deadline is close (May 18), they&amp;rsquo;re keen to get the word out to get as many applicants as possible.  So, if you qualify (PhD or equivalent in philosophy, teaching experience, some research publications) then hop to it and apply.  The details are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vacancies.auckland.ac.nz/positiondetail.asp?p=5057&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This Tuesday, I&amp;rsquo;m going to a &lt;em&gt;party&lt;/em&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s a launch for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/staff/Christine%20Parker&#34;&gt;Christine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Lawyers-Ethics-Christine-Parker/dp/0521546648/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Inside Lawyers&amp;rsquo; Ethics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which she&amp;rsquo;s coauthored with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.law.monash.edu.au/staff/aevans.html&#34;&gt;Adrian Evans&lt;/a&gt; from Monash Law School.  The book will be launched by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/414787&#34;&gt;Louise Sylvan&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.accc.gov.au/&#34;&gt;ACCC&lt;/a&gt;.  This party will be held at the Monash University Law Chambers in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, Christine and Adrian!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be the season for book launches.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://simoncareyholt.typepad.com/&#34;&gt;Simon Holt&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;God Next Door&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://simoncareyholt.typepad.com/weblog/2007/03/god_next_door.html&#34;&gt;launching on April 19&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://braininavat.net/&#34;&gt;Matt Carter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Minds and Computers&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://braininavat.net/weblog/archives/000407.html&#34;&gt;launching on April 23&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Banff: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;Liveblogging talks was a bit beyond me, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping up with a few notes on the talks &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;here in Banff&lt;/a&gt;.  They&amp;rsquo;re not as extensive as my notes on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/#commentbox&#34;&gt;Branden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_delia_graff_fara&#34;&gt;Delia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talks, but they&amp;rsquo;ll give you an idea of the fun we&amp;rsquo;ve been having here.  (After lunch today, there&amp;rsquo;s a batch of five talks, including mine.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write up comments on those, since before dinner I have to catch a shuttle to Calgary to catch a plane early tomorrow morning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after the jump, comments on the talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-afternoon&#34;&gt;Monday afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC Beall&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/glanzberg/home.htm&#34;&gt;Michael Glanzberg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/beall-glanzberg.pdf&#34;&gt;Truth and Paradox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this was a very nice talk, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there!  I misread the program, and thought it was at 3pm and not 2pm.  So, I missed out on it.  At least it gave JC a chance to make some jokes at my expense&amp;hellip;  I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/beall-glanzberg.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; to catch up, since I am &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bradwardine-banff-talk.pdf&#34;&gt;talking about&lt;/a&gt; truth and paradoxes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://members.cox.net/wehmeier/&#34;&gt;Kai Wehmeier&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Identity is not a relation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kai&amp;rsquo;s elegant talk was on Wittgensteinian predicate logic: logic in which distinct variables must denote distinct objects, and in which we do not have an identity predicate.  It seems well suited to introductory logic classes &amp;ndash; or at least, better suited to some untutored judgements about how to say things &amp;ndash; since to say &amp;ldquo;there are two *F*s&amp;rdquo; you simply say (&amp;#8707;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)(&amp;#8707;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;)(&lt;em&gt;Fx&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Fy&lt;/em&gt;), and we don&amp;rsquo;t require the usual (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8800; &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;) conjunct.  Kai looked at how one might extend this logic to include names.  This is a tricky thing to get right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting material.  There are a number of different reasons one might want Wittgensteinian predicate logic: the metaphysical reason (identity just &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; a relation, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;relate&lt;/em&gt;), and the linguistic data.  Kai thinks the metaphysical reason is the most interesting one.  That&amp;rsquo;s probably right.   I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; parallels with linguistic data will draw you further away from Wittgensteinian logic since it stays quite close to the syntax of classical predicate logic.  I think that the linguistic data is better modelled by including even more &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; features in the formal language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ynm/&#34;&gt;Yiannis Moschovakis&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Synonymy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yiannis gave a clear talk looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ynm/papers/lcmsfinal.pdf&#34;&gt;his development&lt;/a&gt; of the &amp;#955;-calculus with recursion clauses as model or account of &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt;, giving an account of synonymy.  The calculus is very elegant: it treats a &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; as an &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; for determining a reference (an idea that is common in everyday explanations of the relationship between sense and reference).  One sweet feature of the calculus is that it can distinguish between synonymy or non-synonymy of different paradoxical senses, which have no reference.  The liar algorithm (to check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, check &lt;em&gt;~p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this&amp;hellip;) differs as an algorithm from the truth-teller algorithm (to check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this&amp;hellip;), even though neither have a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca/people/~byi&#34;&gt;Byeong-Uk Yi&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Is Logic axiomatisable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byeong-Uk talked about compactness and the logic of plurals.  There were lots of examples of arguments that show that if we take plural constructions to be within the scope of logic (and surely, why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they be?), then we&amp;rsquo;ll have failures of compactness.  (Some arguments with infinitely many premies are not valid if we use any finite subset of those premises.)  The examples are good, though I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of them.   I think it will help if we have an idea of what logic is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, or other ways to demarcate the logical from the non-logical, to see the pros-and-cons of choices concerning compactness and non-compactness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-evening&#34;&gt;Monday evening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we had four wonderful short (15 minute!) talks by graduate students: Kate Manne (formerly of Melbourne, now at MIT), on supervaluations; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/&#34;&gt;Kenny Easwaran&lt;/a&gt; (Berkeley) on probability and dominance reasoning; Eleni Kalyvianaki (Athens) developing Yainnis&amp;rsquo; calculus for meaning, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/~rurbania/&#34;&gt;Rafal Urbaniak&lt;/a&gt; (Calgary) on Lesniewski&amp;rsquo;s calculus.  All four were slick, elegant and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-morning&#34;&gt;Tuesday morning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2007/02/modality-morning.html&#34;&gt;Modality Morning&lt;/a&gt;.  First up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kracht.humnet.ucla.edu/marcus/index.html&#34;&gt;Marcus Kracht&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The certain past and possible future of modal logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a survey talk: the first part, on propositional modal logic, and the second part, on modal &lt;em&gt;predicate&lt;/em&gt; logic.  Modal predicate logic is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s full of philosophical questions.  In the survey, Marcus looked at different options for giving semantics for modal predicate logic. Marcus mentioned the work of Shehtman &amp;amp; Skvortsov  on modal &amp;ldquo;metaframes&amp;rdquo;.  This was new to me.  These metaframes treat don&amp;rsquo;t contain a domain of &amp;lsquo;objects&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the quantifier is treated as another kind of context shift &amp;ndash; between different horizontal &amp;lsquo;slices&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the individual frames. This was interesting.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://kleene.ss.uci.edu/~aldo/&#34;&gt;Aldo&lt;/a&gt; and I had the same thought: another connection between quantifiers and modalities is that quantifiers themselves are &lt;em&gt;families&lt;/em&gt; of modal operators &amp;ndash; one for each variable.  In a frame semantics we should have points of evaluation, and the quantifiers and modalities each shift us around in the frame.  Different conditions give us different interactions between quantifiers and modalities.  It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to get a very general picture of how this works, and when the different accessibility conditions &amp;lsquo;factor out&amp;rsquo; into a domain of worlds and a domain of objects.  For more of Marcus&amp;rsquo;s line on this material, see his paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/counterparts.pdf&#34;&gt;Logically Possible Worlds and Counterpart Semantics for Modal Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~okutz/&#34;&gt;Oliver Kutz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/&#34;&gt;Steve Awodey&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/awodey.pdf&#34;&gt;Topological semantics for first-order modal logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (joint with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~kok6/&#34;&gt;Kohei Kishida&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very different talk.  It was not general, but highly specific: Steve presented a very elegant topological (sheaf) semantics for quanitfied S4.  The logic is not complete for the obvious frame semantics.  However, the sheaf semantics is completely natural and completely elegant.  There are &amp;ldquo;worlds&amp;rdquo; (the points in the space underlying the sheaf) and objects (the elements in the fibres), and the objects can generally vary from &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;world.&amp;rdquo;  The difference with standard frame semantics comes in the interpretation of the modality: in the natural models it is not intrepreted by an accessibility relation, but generally by a topological interior operator (as is well known in the interpretation of propositional S4 in topological spaces).  The heavy duty mathematics comes from the sheaf theory required to prove completeness.  The &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; is elegant.  I have not yet seen the &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophical work will come in the interpretation of these results. What does it &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?  The exciting technical work comes in the extensions.  For what other systems do techniques like these work? I&amp;rsquo;d love to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-afternoon&#34;&gt;Tuesday afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two talks in the afternoon were on &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0114/&#34;&gt;Volker Halbach&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Kripke-Feferman theory of truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volker explained how the internal and external logic of truth differ for the Kripke&amp;ndash;Feferman (KF) theory of truth.  It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt; theory, but what it says about &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; is not classical.  We have &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8744; ~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; as a theorem, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have T&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8744; T~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  One way to make them match up is to &lt;em&gt;weaken&lt;/em&gt; the external logic to be &lt;em&gt;partial&lt;/em&gt;.  Volker showed that doing this would weaken the theory considerably.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a part of the paper, but this is an argument for his favoured theory of truth Friedman&amp;ndash;Sheard (FS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/jketland/&#34;&gt;Jeff Ketland&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Truth and Reflection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was on the structure of &lt;em&gt;deflationism&lt;/em&gt;, the view that truth is a purely formal notion and not a substantial one. (Whatever that means &amp;ndash; Jeff noted that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make these much more than slogans.)  One way to make this clearer is to focus on some precise issues.  Should adding a truth predicate be &lt;em&gt;conservative&lt;/em&gt; over a theory without the truth predicate (should it leave the ground-level theory &lt;em&gt;untouched&lt;/em&gt; meaning that you can&amp;rsquo;t prove anything new about the basic theory)?  Should it give you &lt;em&gt;reflection&lt;/em&gt;?  That is, the addition of truth to a theory &lt;em&gt;Th&lt;/em&gt; enable you to prove, relative to that theory, that every claim of that theory is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;?  This seems plausible &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just a generalisation of the claim that if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (in the old theory) then T&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  Jeff rehearsed the argument why you can&amp;rsquo;t have both conservativity and reflection in general.  Why not?  Take a theory of arithmetic.  If we have reflection, then we can prove that the original theory is consistent (at least if the truth predicate behaves sensibly).  He went on to explain why you want &lt;em&gt;reflection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I think about this.  Reflection &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; reasonable, given that we don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; favourite (axiomatisable, consistent) theory of arithmetic &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re all incomplete &amp;ndash; would it be so bad to have a series of theories of arithmetic, of increasing strength, such that when we add a truth predicate to one of the theories in the series, you get another theory in the series.  Is this enough conservativity, and enough reflection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bris.ac.uk/philosophy/department/staff/hl.html&#34;&gt;Hannes Leitgeb&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/leitgeb.pdf&#34;&gt;Applications of mathematics to philosophy: four case studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannes Leitgeb has written &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/h7813l8j5g324766/&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/j85373r152218p0m/&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2731731994655g3/&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg628jx481l41785/&#34;&gt;tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.ndjfl/1012429715&#34;&gt;uth&lt;/a&gt;.  But he didn&amp;rsquo;t give talk about truth this time.  Instead we had very-elegant explanations of four (no, five! &amp;ndash; we had a free extra) different ways mathematics can be applied to philosophical problems. It was a great example of Hannes&amp;rsquo;s work.   As Alasdair Urquhart said in conversation, it was very &lt;em&gt;Carnapian&lt;/em&gt; in its optimism for how creative formal theorising can clarify philosophical issues.  It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; neat.  Go read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/leitgeb.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; to get some idea of the many intresting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet more to come&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finished up the slides for my talk in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, the slides are available here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bradwardine-banff-talk.pdf&#34;&gt;Modal Models for Bradwardine&amp;rsquo;s Truth&lt;/a&gt; [1.3MB pdf]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a talk giving a modal logic interpretation for a medieval theory of truth due to Thomas Bradwardine, as it&amp;rsquo;s reconstructed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt;.  This will hopefully help out Steve&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/medieval.html&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;, by providing tools for exploring the strength of this kind of theory of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write up an extended paper version of this after getting comments from the audience.  Since the audience contains people who know a heck of a lot more than me about truth and about modal logic, I&amp;rsquo;m a little more on the anxious side than usual for such things.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The next &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff talk&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.princeton.edu/~graff/&#34;&gt;Delia Graff Fara&lt;/a&gt;, on &amp;ldquo;Relative identity and de re modality.&amp;rdquo;  She&amp;rsquo;s defending the thesis that material objects are identical to the matter of which they&amp;rsquo;re constituted.  For example, the statue Goliath (&lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;) is identical to the lump of clay Lumpel (&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;).  She wants to allow that &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, while having &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; differing in their temporal and modal properties.  So, for example, in the future, a some more clay might become a part of the statue &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, while not becoming a part of the lump of clay &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;. The original lump of clay is still present (and is joined by more clay), the original statue is still present, and is now &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt;.  You can see why this is desirable: after the addition of more clay, there&amp;rsquo;s still only one statue there, and the old statue did not disappear only to be replaced by a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delia wants to preserve the truth of claims that statues don&amp;rsquo;t have all their parts essentially, while portions of matter do have their parts essentially, while holding that statues are identical to portions of matter.  How can we do this?  I find this kind of work interesting, but deeply difficult.  Delia&amp;rsquo;s talk had a fair bit of relatively informal philosophy in it &amp;ndash; it was a discussion of counterpart relations and such critters &amp;ndash; and other participants followed the dialectic more closely than I did.  I always get confused by this kind of problem.  There are other talks at the workshop on quantified modal logic, which will hopefully give me some helpful ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Banff: Branden Fitelson on Formal Epistemology</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2007 03:22:30 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The first talk in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff&lt;/a&gt; is by &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org&#34;&gt;Branden Fitelson&lt;/a&gt;, who is giving a &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org/banff_handout.pdf&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Survey&amp;rdquo; of Formal Epistemology: some propaganda, and an example&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=formal+epistemology&#34;&gt;general movement&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=&#34;http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/R/Wayne.D.Riggs-1/epistemology/index.html&#34;&gt;carving out&lt;/a&gt; the discipline of &amp;lsquo;formal epistemology&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a partly political talk, recounting the motivation for Formal Epistemology.  He recounted Bob Meyer&amp;rsquo;s manifesto of the &amp;ldquo;Logicians Liberation League.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s worth recounting the section Branden quoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be deceived, Establishment pigs (this means you too, Establishment dogs). The subservience of past generations of logicians does not mean that we shall bear forever our treatment as animals (you barnyard fowl). We are human beings (you swine). You are living in a day when logicians will not any longer endure your taunts, your slurs, your insults (you filthy vermin). In the name of A. N. Whitehead and B. Russell we gather; in the spirit of R. Carnap and A. Tarski, we march; by the word of W. V. O. Quine, we shall prevail. Beware you snakes of the Philosophical Power Structure, which you have created and which you maintain to put down the logician; you have caged the eagle of reason, the dove of wisdom, and the lark of a definite, precisely formulated formal system, with exact formation rules, a recursive set of axioms, and clear and cogent rules of inference, and you have made them your pigeons. Oh, you filterable viruses, we will shake you off and fly once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifesto was presented in 1969, but according to Branden it has relevance today: Branden sees &amp;ldquo;Formal Epistemology&amp;rdquo; as the application of formal techniques to broadly epistemological philosophical questions &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty broad.  Branden sees it as formal techniques applied to all areas of philosophy other than metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the talk cashed out a parallel between a &amp;ldquo;relevantist&amp;rdquo; argument against classical deductive logic and the Goodman &amp;ldquo;grue&amp;rdquo; argument against Carnapian inductive logic.  Branded argued that the friend of Carnapian inductive logic can make the same kind of response to the &amp;ldquo;paradoxes of confirmation&amp;rdquo; that the friend of classical logic can against the &amp;ldquo;paradoxes of entailment&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; to distinguish entailment/consequence and the constraints on rational inference.  What do you need to do in the case of inductive logic?  It turns on the &lt;em&gt;Requirement of Total Evidence&lt;/em&gt;: that evidential support is always defined only in terms of the total evidence available to the agent in the situation. (I won&amp;rsquo;t rehearse the entire argument here: check &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org/banff_handout.pdf&#34;&gt;Branden&amp;rsquo;s slides&lt;/a&gt; for the details.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks right to me.  The interesting issue one has when one rejects a bridge principle like this (between entailment and rational infererence, or between evidential support and the totality of evidence available) is to give an alternative explanation of the tie between the two things thought to be connected by the bridge.  People thought the bridge principle was plausible for a reason.  Those of us (Gilbert Harman in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Change-View-Principles-Gilbert-Harman/dp/0262081555/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Change in View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and JC and me in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Pluralism-J-C-Beall/dp/0199288410/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) have to say something about the connection between deductive consequence and rational inference.  Similarly, Branden (and any defender of an inductive logic) should say something about what bridge principles are plausible and not suspect to these paradoxes.  Branden will be trying out some of these principles in his forthcoming book on inductive logic.&lt;/p&gt;

The program is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pims.math.ca/birs/workshops/2007/07w5060/Programme07w5060.pdf&#34;&gt;very full&lt;/a&gt;, and I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to report on &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; going on here.  (Heck, I haven&amp;rsquo;t even reported back from our time in India, despite &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/12/19/off_to_india/&#34;&gt;popular demand&lt;/a&gt;.)  So, please let me give my apologies in advance if youre talk doesn&amp;rsquo;t get reported here.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably because I was so interested in it I had to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; and not blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having too much fun and doing too much work lately to post anything here.  On the work side, our proposal to teach first-year logic in an interdisciplinary way as a &amp;ldquo;breadth&amp;rdquo; subject to all students in the &amp;ldquo;new generation&amp;rdquo; degrees from 2008, has passed the first hurdle.  We have a bucket of money to develop the course over the next year.  Lots of work, but lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fun side, we&amp;rsquo;ve been getting ready to go to India for our family holiday.  Landing in Mumbai, we go straight to Pune for Christmas with friends, and then we wend our way down the south-east coast on our way to Trivandrum. We&amp;rsquo;re off tomorrow, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be back in Melbourne on January 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My son, Z, asks me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad, what is &lt;em&gt;Kantian freedom&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some time later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad, what is a &lt;em&gt;conceptual repertoire&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, he&amp;rsquo;s not a philosophical prodigy. He was curious about what I was reading, and I explained that I had an essay written by a student, and I had to figure out how good it was.  It happened to be an essay about John McDowell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Mind-World-John-McDowell/dp/0674576101/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Mind and World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, primarily on animal perception and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up having a good conversation about whether or not &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/erasmus_christmas.jpg&#34;&gt;our cat, Erasmus&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; (Z thought &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;, and I confessed being to being thoroughly confused on the matter after having read too many McDowell essays).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a McDowell expert, but I&amp;rsquo;m the second examiner, brushing up on my knowledge by reading a batch of honours essays. On the whole, they&amp;rsquo;ve been very good.  (Before this week I&amp;rsquo;d never seen a philosophy essay in the form of an &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/enoughrope&#34;&gt;extended interview with Andrew Denton&lt;/a&gt;.  &amp;ldquo;So, John, tell us how we can get off the seesaw between the Myth of the Given and the frictionless void&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, it&amp;rsquo;s my logic honours essays, and three honours theses.  Could be another long evening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Two bits of horn tooting for today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, from the famous and notorious &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/&#34;&gt;Philosophical Gourmet Report&lt;/a&gt;. Brian Leiter &lt;a href=&#34;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/pgr_makes_the_n.html&#34;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the report &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20757575-14981,00.html&#34;&gt;hit the newspaper&lt;/a&gt; here in Australia.  The point of the little note in the Higher Education section of &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; was that the ANU topped the rankings of Australian philosophy departments (as it has in the past), over Sydney and Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously the article picks out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown.asp&#34;&gt;discipline specific areas&lt;/a&gt; where Melbourne scored higher than ANU (Applied Ethics) and where ANU scored higher (Metaphysics).  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised that Melbourne did well in Applied Ethics, since we have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/cappe&#34;&gt;a centre&lt;/a&gt; devoted to it, and there are lots of good things going on in the field.  We ranked very well internationally in that area (we end up in the cohort of the top 7-18 departments in the survey).  What &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s report didn&amp;rsquo;t mention was that Melbourne also scored respectably well in Philosophical Logic. (Here, we&amp;rsquo;re in the cohort of the top 5-12.)  I suppose one salient difference is that in philosophical logic, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a named centre: we just a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#graham&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#allen&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#baz&#34;&gt;do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#greg&#34;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the second bit of shameless self-promotion concerning logic at Melbourne: You might have heard about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://growingesteem.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;process of institutional change&lt;/a&gt; taking place at &lt;a href=&#34;http://unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;this University&lt;/a&gt;.  One part of this is the introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;http://melbournemodel.unimelb.edu.au/new_generation.html&#34;&gt;new undergraduate degrees&lt;/a&gt;.  One part of this is the development of new &amp;lsquo;breadth&amp;rsquo; subjects, to teach material to students across the university system: I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with colleagues on a proposal to teach a new first-year undergraduate unit &amp;ldquo;Logic: Language &amp;amp; Information,&amp;rdquo; collaboratively between &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistics.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ee.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;electrical &amp;amp; electronic engineering&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea is that we teach propositional and predicate logic with lots of different applications in the related fields. It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit of a tricky process, but now that it&amp;rsquo;s all come together, the thing looks like it might fly.  With such interesting people here like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/Personnel/profile.php?PC_id=376&#34;&gt;Greg Hjorth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.ee.unimelb.edu.au/staff/davoren/&#34;&gt;Jen Davoren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~sb/&#34;&gt;Steven Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistics.unimelb.edu.au/about/staff/profiles/stirling/&#34;&gt;Lesley Stirling&lt;/a&gt;, we can teach a pretty good course on logic &amp;amp; language.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Philosophical Poll: on a priori knowledge of possibilities</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/11/01/a_philosophical_poll_on_a_priori_knowledge_of_possibilities/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2006 16:56:32 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/11/01/a_philosophical_poll_on_a_priori_knowledge_of_possibilities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to guage some philosophical opinions.  (I don&amp;rsquo;t have many of my own.  Most of them have been worn down by &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;years of logical abuse&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some pre-requisites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s understand &amp;lsquo;possibly&amp;rsquo; as a &lt;em&gt;metaphysical&lt;/em&gt; sort of possibility.  If it helps, think of it as truth in some possible world, no matter how outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s understand &lt;em&gt;a priori knowledge&lt;/em&gt; in the way that all of the people who talk about &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge understand the term.  Plausibly, we can&amp;rsquo;t know that Hesperus is Phosphorus &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, but, plausibly, we can know the Chinese Remainder Theorem &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the question. Can we have &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of any proposition of the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;possibly ~&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true?  (We don&amp;rsquo;t need to know &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true.)  Speaking rather briskly, do we have &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge that fatalism is false? (Where &amp;lsquo;fatalism&amp;rsquo; is the thesis that everything that is true is metaphysically necessary.)  This is fudging a scope distinction, commuting a propositional quantifier under the knowledge operator, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much of a worry.  If you think that there&amp;rsquo;s a proposition &amp;lsquo;@&amp;rsquo; true in the actual world alone (of any of the possible worlds accessible from the actual world) then, the question reduces to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we know &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; that possibly ~@?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think?  What do the &lt;em&gt;Standard Positions&lt;/em&gt; on these topics (&lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, necessity, semantics, etc.) say about this?   Is there anything that we obviously have &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of that clearly &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; entails possibly ~@?  (That&amp;rsquo;d be interesting: I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any examples right now&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person to have opinions on these sorts of issues, let me know what you think in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masses of Formal Philosophy: Question 2</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/09/16/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2006 13:30:54 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/09/16/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my (&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/04/19/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_1/index.php&#34;&gt;much delayed&lt;/a&gt;) answer to the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; of Vincent Hendricks and John Symons&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/Masses/index.html&#34;&gt;five questions about &lt;em&gt;Formal Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-example-from-your-work-illustrates-the-role-formal-methods-can-play-in-philosophy&#34;&gt;What example from your work illustrates the role formal methods can play in philosophy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on one example from some of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years I have been working on topics in proof theory and connections between the way we can conceive of the structure of proofs and concerns in the theory of meaning.   The idea that the meaning of a word or a concept might be usefully explicated by giving an account of its inferential role is a common one &amp;ndash; the work of Ned Block, Bob Brandom and Michael Dummett are three very different examples of ways to take this idea seriously.  It is a truism that meaning has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; sort of connection with use, and use in reasoning and inference is a very important part of any account of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has seemed to me that if we are going to take take inferential role as playing its part in a theory of meaning, then we had better use the best available tools for giving an account of proof.  The theory of proofs should have something to teach philosophers who have interests in semantics.  This is not a mainstream position &amp;ndash; our vocabulary itself speeks against this, with the ready identification of model theory with &amp;lsquo;semantics&amp;rsquo; and proof theory with &amp;lsquo;syntax&amp;rsquo;. The work of intuitionists such as Dummett, Prawitz, Martin-L&amp;ouml;f and Tennant in conspicuous in its isolation at providing a contrary opinion to the mainstream.   This has led to the opinion that semantically anti-realist positions &amp;ndash; those that take proof or inference as the starting point of semantic theory, rather than truth-conditions or representation &amp;ndash; are naturally revisionary and intuitionist.  For intuitionistic logic has a clear motivation in terms of proof and verification, and it has seemed to many that orthodox classical logic does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a mistake.  It seems to me that natural proof-theoretic accounts of classical logic (starting with Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus, but also newer pieces of technology such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;proof-nets&lt;/a&gt;) can have a central place in a theory of meaning that starts with inferential role and not with truth.  We can think of the valid sequents (of the form &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A2; &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; are sets of statements) as helping us &amp;lsquo;keep score&amp;rsquo; in dialectical positions.  The validity of the sequent &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A2; &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; tells us that a position in dialogue in which each statement in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is asserted and each statement in &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is denied is out of bounds according to the rules of &amp;lsquo;the game.&amp;rsquo;  In fact, the structural rules in the sequent calculus can be motivated in this way.  Identity sequents &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A2; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; tell us that asserting and denying &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (in the same context) is out of bounds.  The rule of weakening tells us that if asserting &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is out of bounds then adding an extra assertion or extra denial would not aid the matter.  The cut rule tells us that if a position in which &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is asserted and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is denied is not out of bounds, then given a statement &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, either the addition as an assertion, or its addition as a denial will also not be out of bounds.  If asserting &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is out of bounds in a context, it is implicitly denied in that context.  Explicitly denying is no worse than implicitly denying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus in this way gives an alternative understanding of classical logic. We think of the rules for connectives as &amp;lsquo;definitions&amp;rsquo; governing assertions featuring the logical vocabulary.  Proof-theoretical techniques such as the eliminability of the &amp;lsquo;cut&amp;rsquo; rule tell us that these definitions are &lt;em&gt;conservative&lt;/em&gt;.  No matter what the rules of the game concerning our primitive vocabulary might be, we can add the classical logical connectives without disturbing the rules of assertion in that primitive vocabulary (the need for this point was made clearly in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~belnap&#34;&gt;Nuel Belnap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/123029&#34;&gt;Tonk, Plonk and Plink&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;). The logical vocabulary allows us to &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Making-Explicit-Representing-Discursive-Commitment/dp/0674543300/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;make explicit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; what was merely &amp;lsquo;implicit&amp;rsquo; before.  The interpretation of the rules of the quantifiers &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/171450&#34;&gt;is particularly enlightening&lt;/a&gt;.  It allows us to sidestep the debate between &amp;lsquo;substitutional&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;objectual&amp;rsquo; accounts of quantification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; I have tried to flesh out this picture, and to show how we can expand this story to take account of appropriate conditions for use for modal connectives such as possibility and necessity.  The key idea is that in modal discourse we not only assert and deny, but we make assertions and denials in different dialectical contexts, and an assertion of a necessity claim in one context can impinge on claims in other dialectical contexts.  This means that we can give a semantics of modal vocabulary that motivates a well-known modal logic (in the first instance, the simple modal logic S5, but the extension to other logics is not difficult) in which possible worlds are not the starting point of semantic explanation.  Modal vocabulary needs not be conceived of as a way of describing possible worlds.  It can be understood as a governing discourse in which we not only assert and deny to express our own commitments, but also to articulate the connections between our concepts.  The structures of dialectical positions need not merely contain assertions and denials, but these may be partitioned into different &amp;lsquo;zones&amp;rsquo; according to structure of the different suppositions and shifts of context in that discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I just had an &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt; today. From here, it seems like a &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Neat&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt;.  (Having the idea made me remember what it feels like to prove something you&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with for a long time: a mix of excitement, wonder, awe, relief, and much else besides. It&amp;rsquo;s welcome to be reminded of why I like working in logic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea isn&amp;rsquo;t a new theorem, but what seems to me to be a simpler proof of an already proved theorem.  I&amp;rsquo;ll try writing it up in the next couple of days and I&amp;rsquo;ll report back.  It could dissolve into dust and vapour, but if it survives the writeup process, I&amp;rsquo;ll be one happy logician.  If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t survive, at least I&amp;rsquo;ll have learned something new.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;Philosophy Department&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re pleased to be hosting some short visits from &lt;a href=&#34;http://logicandlanguage.net/&#34;&gt;Gillian Russell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://thatlogicblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/ahoy-melbourne.html&#34;&gt;Jon Cohen&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s neat to be in a place where smart people come to visit, think and talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we had a couple of logic seminars from neat west-coast of the USA types: &lt;a href=&#34;https://webfiles.berkeley.edu:443/titelbaum/home.htm&#34;&gt;Mike Titelbaum&lt;/a&gt; from Berkeley and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~peters/&#34;&gt;Stanley Peters&lt;/a&gt; from Stanford.  At drinks after the logic seminar I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iccs.inf.ed.ac.uk/~steedman/&#34;&gt;Mark Steedman&lt;/a&gt; from Edinburgh, and it was nice to have a symmetric reaction &amp;ldquo;oh, you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; for &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; in {&amp;lsquo;MS&amp;rsquo;,&amp;lsquo;GR&amp;rsquo;}.  He was able to fill me in on the very interesting work done on substructrual logics, categorial grammar, and statistical parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ten Questions about Books</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/29/ten_questions_about_books/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/29/ten_questions_about_books/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcrankers.blogspot.com/2006/07/book-meme.html&#34;&gt;Jo asked so nicely&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll add my answers to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2006/07/one-book-meme.html&#34;&gt;one book meme&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s going around the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book that changed your life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert C. Roberts, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802819397/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Spirituality and Human Emotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s because of this book that I&amp;rsquo;m a philosopher, believe it or not.  Reading it, I saw that the philosophy needn&amp;rsquo;t be self-contained, but could be used to say something productive and interesting about matters of human concern.  In my undergraduate years I spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time reading theology, and I learned most from the literature that was philosohpical in technique and in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;ve read more than once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. S. Lewis, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0064471071/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My out-and-out favourite of the Narnia Chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;d want on a desert island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gospel according to John&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Following Jo&#39;s example, I&#39;ll treat different biblical books as different books.  For me it&#39;s a toss-up for different gospels, but John&#39;s the one I&#39;m least &#39;at home&#39; with and I think it bears repeated readings, as is fitting on a desert island.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book that made you laugh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanislaw Lem, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156027593/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Cyberiad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an intellectual laugh mostly, rather than slapstick, but there are laughs on each page of these wise, knowing, sensitive tales of the robot constructors Trurl and Klaupacius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book that made you cry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Mitchell, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375507256/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A truly vertiginous read: six interlocking stories from the 1850s, through the present, to the near future and after the collapse of civilisation.  Deeply moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;One&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Two&lt;/ins&gt; book&lt;ins&gt;s&lt;/ins&gt; you wish had been written&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Routley, &lt;em&gt;Exploring Meinong&amp;rsquo;s Jungle &amp;amp; Beyond, &lt;ins&gt;the edited version&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0685056368/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;existing version&lt;/a&gt; version is an amazing read, but with a good &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; it could have changed the face of philosophy in this country.  In a very good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Anderson, Nuel Belnap, J. Michael Dunn &lt;ins&gt;and Robert K. Meyer&lt;/ins&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Entailment, Volume 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691073392/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;existing &lt;em&gt;Entailment, Vol 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is very good, but the version that was foreshadowed in the first volume of &lt;em&gt;Entailment&lt;/em&gt; would have been fantastic.  But that would have required the continuing of the Belnap/Meyer collaboration, which broke down in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you wish had never been written&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to answer this question, so I&amp;rsquo;ll interpret it differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Marr and Marian Wilkinson, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1741144477/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Dark Victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unutterably sad that this book &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be written.  I wish that it had been impossible to write because the events had never taken place.  Instead, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to make sure that they never happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;re currently reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PD James, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446364622/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Children of Men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a thing for well-written dystopias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to read&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Tudge,  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141009500/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;So Shall we Reap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; I started reading this before the sabbatical last year, and I didn&#39;t take it with me -- it&#39;s still lying in my pile of things to read.  It&#39;s got a wonderful subtitle: &amp;quot;How Everyone Who Is Liable to Be Born in the Next Ten Thousand Years Could Eat Very Well Indeed; and Why, in Practice, Our Immediate Descendants Are Likely to Be in Serious Trouble&amp;quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tag five people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this and want to do write your own answers, consider yourself tagged.  Answer the questions on your own blog and link here in the comments, or answer in the comments for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>On the Interview</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/22/on_the_interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2006 19:24:00 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/22/on_the_interview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/07/18/interviewed_again/&#34;&gt;the interview&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how it went.  The ABC team did a good job with the editing (I think the interview I recorded was a bit over 30 minutes).  I never thought that I&amp;rsquo;d live to hear the day that someone explained the semantics of first degree entailment on national radio, and I was especially grateful that my little plug for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sylvan&#34;&gt;Richard Sylvan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/&#34;&gt;Bob Meyer&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t end up on the cutting-room floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your edification, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1689459.htm&#34;&gt;transcript is of the interview here&lt;/a&gt; and the audio is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/feeds/pze_20060722.mp3&#34;&gt;MP3 file available for the next four weeks&lt;/a&gt;.  You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/subscribe/&#34;&gt;subscribe to a podcast&lt;/a&gt; of the program if you like to hear this kind of thing more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re visiting my website on following the link from the Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone page and you want to know more about logic, there are a few things you could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download my little introductory article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logic_chapter/&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; in a nice volume called the &lt;em&gt;Fundamentals of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; edited by John Shand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My textbook, also imaginatively entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/logic/&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an introduction to the subject, geared to philosophy students.  You can order it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415400686/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415400686/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in &lt;em&gt;pluralism&lt;/em&gt; about logic, the topic I ended my discussion with Alan on, then you&amp;rsquo;ll want to have a look at my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logical_pluralism/&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; co-authored with my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC Beall&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Connecticut.  You can get this book from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199288410/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199288410/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the car this evening, Z (our five-and-a-bit year-old son) says, unprompted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reply &amp;ldquo;yes &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; why does Kim Beazely want to be Prime Minister?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that he&amp;rsquo;s keeping up with his world. It&amp;rsquo;s telling that we found it difficult to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interviewed again</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/18/interviewed_again/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2006 14:58:15 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/18/interviewed_again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning I trooped down to the ABC Melbourne studios in Southbank, to sit in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://imaginingaustralia.blogs.com/photos/launch/andrewpetetardisbooth.html&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Tardis&amp;rsquo; booth&lt;/a&gt; to talk to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/about/default.htm#presenter&#34;&gt;Alan Saunders of &lt;em&gt;The Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on logic, the liar paradox and other stuff I think about.  Alan was feeling unwell and suffering from a croaky voice, so the interview that goes to air might be more of a monologue than what took place in the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it was good fun to do the interview: Alan&amp;rsquo;s a good interviewer and he knows his stuff. Tune in or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1689459.htm&#34;&gt;download the interview&lt;/a&gt; once it airs on July 22.  (The ABC keeps these program files online for a month.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you, like me, are interested in this kind of radio program, you can always &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/subscribe/default.htm#podcasting&#34;&gt;subscribe to the podcast&lt;/a&gt; to get the latest program when it is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I was &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/06/06/interviewed/&#34;&gt;interviewed for &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this month, it&amp;rsquo;s radio.  What is coming next?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assorted Observations</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/07/assorted_observations/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2006 23:23:59 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/07/07/assorted_observations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to get back into the swing of work, but I&amp;rsquo;m slowly clawing my way through.  Jetlag has been &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse on my return than on the European end of the trip.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also been concentrating on my parental duties, as my Significant Other is taking her conference trip. Playing with your son is much more fun than doing niggly administrative tasks.  If you&amp;rsquo;re awaiting an email reply from me, it should be coming in the next few days. The delay is nothing personal &amp;ndash; the queue is rather long right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promised observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you speak to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/about/default.htm#presenter&#34;&gt;radio presenter&lt;/a&gt; on the telephone, it sounds eerily like you are talking to a radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you buy your coffee on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pb.unimelb.edu.au/CampusMaps/Parkville.pdf&#34;&gt;campus&lt;/a&gt;, pricing varies from place-to-place.   Now, despite the fact that &lt;em&gt;Plush Fish&lt;/em&gt; (the sushi place), &lt;em&gt;Chill Out&lt;/em&gt; (the rice paper rolls and juice place) and &lt;em&gt;Caf&amp;eacute; Suave&lt;/em&gt; (the place in the commerce courtyard, near the Ballieu Library) are run by the same people, the price you pay &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; for your fairtrade coffee differs from place to-place.  This week I have paid a 30 cent premium for faitrade at Plush Fish and Chill Out but only 10 cents at Caf&amp;eacute; Suave.  This could be either a subtle marketing exercise (their selling fairtrade coffee is a recent innovation) or an error in the programming of their cash registers, or something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on fairtrade coffee on campus, check &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hooked.org.au/mu&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing for the fairtrade coffee is on top of the base of $3.10 price for my medium skim milk flat white with no sugar. It is a mouthful to order, saying &amp;lsquo;a medium skim milk fairtrade flat white with no sugar, please&amp;rsquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s the way of the world.  At least I don&amp;rsquo;t order &lt;em&gt;decaf&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes ordering coffee as complex as ordering a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/metcard/fares_zones/&#34;&gt;metcard&lt;/a&gt;. Try remembering a &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/metcard/fares_zones/10xtwo_hour.php&#34;&gt;10 trip, 2 hour, zone 1, full fare metcard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; each time you need one.  I&amp;rsquo;ve never managed to get it right.  Today I asked for a &amp;lsquo;2 trip, 10 hour, zone 1, full fare metcard&amp;rsquo; which would not be the same thing at all.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had some long tram journeys, but none have been 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should order my metcards over the &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/metcard/store/&#34;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;.  (They promise to mail them to you for free.)  That way I&amp;rsquo;d not have to embarrass myself in front of a flesh-and-blood human being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back in Melbourne, after my whirlwind jaunt in Nancy.  I was in too much of a rush on Day 4 of the conference to post thoughts on Day 3 or Day 4.  I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll do that once I recover from my jetlag and deal with my growing pile of mail, both snail and electronic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the nicest thing about reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/adventures-in-blog-land/2006/07/01/1151174437503.html?page=fullpage&#34;&gt;this article on blogging in this morning&amp;rsquo;s newspaper&lt;/a&gt; was hearing Z&amp;rsquo;s laugh when he recognised that a picture of me was in the newspaper. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s you, Dad!&amp;rdquo; he chortled when he recognised me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Here in Nancy, Day 2</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/06/30/here_in_nancy_day_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2006 17:29:03 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/06/30/here_in_nancy_day_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Nancy Day 2 was a quiet as far as the official program went.  Talks were scheduled in the morning leaving the afternoon free.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/lynch/lynch.htm&#34;&gt;Michael Lynch&lt;/a&gt; and I took in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.culture.fr/PublicItems/musees/5439506&#34;&gt;Mus&amp;eacute;e des Beaux-Arts&lt;/a&gt; and talked philosophy and much else with &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/&#34;&gt;Peter van Inwagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/SS/index.htm&#34;&gt;Scott Shalkowski&lt;/a&gt; and others into the evening and late in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning featured a well-put-together talk by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/?username=dfl0ejl&#34;&gt;Jonathan Lowe&lt;/a&gt; on the contrast between his robust essentialism and conceptualism.  For Jonathan, conceptualism collapses into a global anti-realism because it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; requires a kind of essentialism about concepts and agents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attended a helpful presentation by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/philuqam/dept/page_perso.php?id=32&#34;&gt;Mathieu Marion&lt;/a&gt; on game semantics for logic.  (For an introduction to game semantics, try the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-games/&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia entry&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~wilfrid/&#34;&gt;Wilfrid Hodges&lt;/a&gt;.) Mathieu contrasted the agonistic conception of game semantics according to which the two players (proponent and opponent, or Abelard and Eloise) are competing against one another.  He proposed a cooperative understanding in which the players are building something together, like a proof.  This strikes me as plausible.  The devil, however, is in the detail.  The distinctive feature of game semantics is that the &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; is not a play of a game, or something you can look back on as having constructed.  A proof corresponds to a winning strategy for the proponent, and a refutation corresponds to a winning strategy for the opponent.  (&lt;em&gt;Parenthetical remark&lt;/em&gt;: Compare this to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/06/13/key_ideas_in_the_theory_of_proofs_1_the_duality_of_proofs_and_counterexamples&#34;&gt;my comments a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; on the duality between proofs and counterexamples.  Game semantics is an account of proofs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; counterexamples.  It seems to be interestingly self-dual.  I should think more about this&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;End parenthetical remark&lt;/em&gt;.)  The issue I find with thinking of game semantics as a cooperative construction of a proof or a refutation is that you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; a proof or refutation through a play of the game.  You construct a proof (or a refutation) through repeated plays of the game where the opponent (or proponent) tries all possible options and the proponent (or opponent) deals with them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will bear more thinking, and I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to do some of that thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now however, I&amp;rsquo;ll attend to Day 3.  The report on Day 3 will hopefully come today or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s been neet, chatching up with people &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nd.edu/~ndphilo/faculty/pva.htm&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/rub.php?lng=en&amp;amp;cat=_insti&amp;amp;rub=r04&amp;amp;srub=01&amp;amp;ssrub=10&amp;amp;m2rub=0&#34;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/SS/index.htm&#34;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/wansing/wansing.html&#34;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.filosofie.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=39&amp;amp;c=36&#34;&gt;while&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, after a not-completely-rested-night as I tried to sleep through a rather rowdy French community beeping car horns after their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&amp;amp;cid=72781&#34;&gt;3-1 victory in the round of 16&lt;/a&gt;, I went to five talks.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the quick run-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/rub.php?lng=en&amp;amp;cat=_insti&amp;amp;rub=r03&amp;amp;srub=01&amp;amp;ssrub=12&amp;amp;sssrub=01&amp;amp;m2rub=2&#34;&gt;Jacques Dubucs&lt;/a&gt; talked about his &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; antirealism, according to which &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; computable functions should play a role in meaning theory rather than the computable functions of more traditional constructive logic.  Dubucs and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/philuqam/dept/page_perso.php?id=32&#34;&gt;Mathieu Marion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stl.recherche.univ-lille3.fr/sitespersonnels/rahman/accueilrahman.html&#34;&gt;Shahid Rahman&lt;/a&gt; are interested in the application of substructural logics (and game semantics) to these matters, and I should have a look at this more.  There are interesting connections between feasibility and structural rules, worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artsci.lsu.edu/phil/phil1/cogburn/index.html&#34;&gt;John Cogburn&lt;/a&gt; gave a nice paper on Moore&amp;rsquo;s paradox for anti-realists.  The Moorean inference is the step from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;ldquo;I believe that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  This inference is clearly wrong, but on semantically anti-realist lights (at least, for those kinds of constructivists for whom an argument is valid if warrant for the premises can be converted into warrant for the conclusion) then it seems valid enough.  If I have warrant for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then this warrant is the kind of thing that convinces me that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;ll believe it.  John pointed out that even for a constructivist, the fact that I can find no particular counterexample to the Moore inference (some proposition such that I assert it but deny that I believe it) it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it valid in the general sense: since for validity, we need the inference to work in any context, and the Moore inference clearly doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  If we suppose that there are truths that I don&amp;rsquo;t believe.  Call one of them, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. From &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; we can&amp;rsquo;t infer &lt;em&gt;Bp&lt;/em&gt;.  We can allow the inference from a statement that we&amp;rsquo;ve asserted to the fact that we believe it, but it&amp;rsquo;s another move to say that this inference under hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;, giving my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/antirealist&#34;&gt;anti/realism paper&lt;/a&gt;.  Not the best presentation of a paper I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done, but I got some good comments on the paper.  Download &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently/writing/antirealism&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; and give me some comments of your own if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lucamoretti.org/&#34;&gt;Luca Moretti&lt;/a&gt; (I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that he was in Sydney at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usyd.edu.au/time&#34;&gt;Centre for Time&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a long way to go to find out that someone is at the other end of the Hume Highway from me) gave a talk about minimalism about truth and whether it&amp;rsquo;s neutral between realism and anti-realism.  Luca pointed out that on Wright&amp;rsquo;s kind of pluralism, we can apply the minimalist &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; principle to the claim that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; (for some choice of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; in mind: Luca chose &amp;ldquo;snow is white&amp;rdquo;, I think).  It&amp;rsquo;s true that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; iff if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, and this biconditional is true necessarily.  (Wright&amp;rsquo;s minimalism is about the &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; biconditional for propositions.)  Now, since it&amp;rsquo;s necessary that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, we can infer that it&amp;rsquo;s necessary that (it&amp;rsquo;s true that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;).  But this has the form &amp;ldquo;necessarily &lt;em&gt;Fa&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (as the claim of truth is a predication of truth to a proposition), and so, we can infer that it&amp;rsquo;s necessary that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; exists.  Here &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is the proposition that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;: this proposition exists necessarily.  This kind of minimialism, allegedly neutral between kinds of realism and anti-realism seems to conclude a kind of realism about propositions.  Sorting out the options here seems quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/lynch/lynch.htm&#34;&gt;Michael Lynch&lt;/a&gt; gave a paper about pluralism about truth, and distinguishing role functionalism about truth from other kinds of pluralism about truth.  The motivating idea is that there are different ways that things can be true: correspondence, coherence, etc., describe different ways that things can be true, and different kinds of things can be true in different ways.  Lynch argued that you can make sense of this kind of intuition if you are happy to say that there&amp;rsquo;s an overarching &lt;em&gt;role&lt;/em&gt; that truth can play and that there are different realisers to this role.  I think that there&amp;rsquo;s something quite interesting in this, however, I&amp;rsquo;m hampered by my lack of a clear understanding when people confidently individuate properties&amp;hellip; (this is common in all discussions of the role/realiser distinction, and I see people having confident intuitions of one property (say pain) realised by another property (brain state)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More blogging later if the wireless is still working. Now I&amp;rsquo;m off to drinks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Key Ideas in the theory of proofs #1: The Duality of Proofs and Counterexamples</title>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/06/13/key_ideas_in_the_theory_of_proofs_1_the_duality_of_proofs_and_counterexamples/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Now that my undergraduate teaching is done for the semester, I can devote more time to research.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this place to post some material from my proof theory project.  My goal is to present some key ideas in an accessible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s idea is the duality between &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;counterexamples&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proofs&lt;/em&gt;: You can think of a valid argument as underwritten by a &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;.  A proof leads from the premises to the conclusions, and shows how the conclusions follow from the premises.  An invalid argument from premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to conclusions &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; is one for which there is no proof leading from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different theories of proofs will characterise these in different ways (natural deduction, Hilbert-style axiom systems, Gentzen-style sequent systems, tableaux, etc.) but at heart, a proof is a formal structure that bears witness to a valid argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterexamples&lt;/em&gt;: You can think of an invalid argument as witnessed by a &lt;em&gt;counterexample&lt;/em&gt;.  A counterexample is a way of making the premises true and the conclusions untrue, and it shows how the conclusions say something &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than what is present in the premises.  A valid argument from premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to conclusions &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; is one for which there is no counterexample rendering &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; true and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different theories of counterexamples (call them &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;interpretations&lt;/em&gt; if you like) characterise them in different ways: truth tables, many-valued algebras, models with domains of quantification or &amp;ldquo;worlds&amp;rdquo; models for intensional logics, but at its heart, a counterexample bears witness to an invalid argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the duality: Proofs witness &lt;em&gt;validity&lt;/em&gt; and counterexamples witness &lt;em&gt;invalidity&lt;/em&gt;.  A proof gives you a &lt;em&gt;validity&lt;/em&gt; fact.  Only an &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of proofs tells you about invalidity.   Conversely, a counterexample gives you an &lt;em&gt;invalidity&lt;/em&gt; fact.  Only an &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of counterexamples tells you about validity.  These two different ways of characterising logical consequence have very very different properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many key results in 20th Century logic, such as G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s completeness theorem, pair together these two notions.  A &lt;em&gt;soundness&lt;/em&gt; result (for a proof system, given some set of counterexamples) tells you that a proof system provides a proof from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;only when&lt;/em&gt; the argument from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; has no counterexample.  A &lt;em&gt;completeness&lt;/em&gt; proof (for a proof system, given some set of counterexamples) tells us that a proof system provides a proof from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;whenever&lt;/em&gt; the argument from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; has no counterexample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a well-matched pair of a system of proofs and a system of counterexamples &amp;ndash; for a notion of logical consequence &amp;ndash; then you have two different ways to look at the one relation between premises and conclusions.  These different tools are useful for different purposes.  If you use just one of them, you might be selling yourself short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Aside&lt;/em&gt;: This was my critical point in my essay &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/facts/&#34;&gt;One Way to Face Facts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;: I found Stephen Neale&amp;rsquo;s excellent little book on slingshot arguments &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0199247153/consequentlyorg?v=glance&#34;&gt;Facing Facts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) helpful, but one-sided.  In the book, we find detailed analysis of different slingshot &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;.  Neale charts which principles combine together to produce unwanted results.  What makes the work one-sided is that he never walks on the other side of the street to look at &lt;em&gt;counterexamples&lt;/em&gt;.  (He never looks at models to show that particular combinations of premises &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; produce the unwarranted conclusions on their own, as you can easily do if you produce counterexamples.)  It is as if he is charting a boundary between territories by making occasional forays from &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; side of the boundary, never realising that you can jump the fence to see it from the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; side as well. &lt;em&gt;End of the aside&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we have two different sorts of tools for characterising valid argument, a philosopher is constitutionally bound to ask a question: Is one of these tools more &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; than the other?  Many would say &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;.  My colleague &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/gp.html&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt; takes counterexamples to be primary, and proofs to only be a means for enumerating the notion of logical consequence given by means of the counterexamples. (See, for example, his paper &amp;ldquo;Validity&amp;rdquo; in Varzi&amp;rsquo;s volume &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/site/157586178X.html&#34;&gt;The Nature of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)  Others, like Dummett&amp;rsquo;s semantic anti-realist or Brandom&amp;rsquo;s inferentialist, would seem to take proof as primary, as you explain the meanings of a concept by articulating its role in &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do we have to choose?  Why think that one way of characterising logical consequence is any &amp;ldquo;deeper&amp;rdquo; than the other? To put things in an more cryptic manner: why think that there is just one direction of &amp;ldquo;depth&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;priority&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I was interviewed by Lisa Mitchell from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au&#34;&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt; about academic blogging.  She&amp;rsquo;s writing an article for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.education.theage.com.au/inpaper.asp&#34;&gt;education supplement&lt;/a&gt; (published on Mondays).  It&amp;rsquo;s a piece with a long lead time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I&amp;rsquo;ll recognise anything I said in the article, and if she&amp;rsquo;ll quote me.  (I blabbed on for 25 minutes.  I hope there was some useful raw material there &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve finished lectures for the semester, and I&amp;rsquo;m officially &lt;em&gt;recovering&lt;/em&gt;.  It was fun teaching &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161212/pub&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;, but it was also a hard slog.  Next semester I have a light teaching load, with my honours logic seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight last week was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2006/05/on-road-again.html&#34;&gt;Richard Zach&amp;rsquo;s visit&lt;/a&gt;.  He gave two nice talks.  One on vagueness and logic &amp;ndash; setting out different options for logic and semantics in the light of vagueness &amp;ndash; and the other, on the epsilon calculus.  (How Richard managed to get through the content of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/papers/etheorem.pdf&#34;&gt;his big paper with Georg Moser&lt;/a&gt; in an hour with each of us following everything, I have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; idea, but he did.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have to slog through some marking, and some writing.  This weekend, however, I&amp;rsquo;m in Adelaide for a little ``logic axis&amp;rdquo; meeting.  I&amp;rsquo;ll give a talk on fixing up Prawitz&amp;rsquo;s proof theory for the positive fragment of the relevant logic R.  I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the written version of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Regret and Slingshots</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/05/02/on_regret_and_slingshots/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2006 23:18:45 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/05/02/on_regret_and_slingshots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a silly puzzle for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regret seems like a factive emotion.  You can&amp;rsquo;t truly regret that you forgot to feed the cat today if, indeed, you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; feed the cat.  If you did feed the cat and you forgot that you did, then it seems to you like you&amp;rsquo;re regretting not feeding the cat, but you&amp;rsquo;re as mistaken about your regret as you are about feeding the cat.  You think you didn&amp;rsquo;t feed the cat and you&amp;rsquo;re sorry that you didn&amp;rsquo;t, but that&amp;rsquo;s not regret.  Or so some people think, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that regret is factive like that.  Then it&amp;rsquo;s plausible to think that the circumstance you&amp;rsquo;re regretting is in some way a &amp;lsquo;component&amp;rsquo; of that regretting.  (On this view, that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s factive: if the circumstance of my not-feeding-the-cat isn&amp;rsquo;t there, then I can&amp;rsquo;t be related to that circumstance in &amp;ldquo;regretful&amp;rdquo; manner.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the case, then it&amp;rsquo;s plausible to think that disjunctive regrets are a strange sort of thing.  Regretting that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; might be a relationship to a situation in which &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true (when it&amp;rsquo;s the truth of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; that makes the disjunction true) or one in which &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true (the other case).  A regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; might be the same kind of thing as a regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; (if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is the case) or a regret that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that in general, a disjunctive regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; since it is a regretting relationship to a circumstance in which &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true &amp;ndash; brings with it a regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or a regret that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, since either the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-or-&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; circumstance is one in which &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true, or it&amp;rsquo;s one in which &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true.  Call this the &lt;em&gt;disjunction&lt;/em&gt; principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems that regretting that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) and regretting that (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) are no different to one another.  Similarly, regretting that (it&amp;rsquo;s not the case that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;)) is no different to regretting that (either it&amp;rsquo;s not the case that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or it&amp;rsquo;s not the case that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) and so on.  It seems a little bit plausible that if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are two statements that are &lt;em&gt;logically equivalent&lt;/em&gt; then regret that &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and regret that &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t differ.   Call this the &lt;em&gt;equivalence&lt;/em&gt; prinicple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, suppose that the classical story of logical equivalence, that you were taught when you were taught truth tables, is correct.  This is enough to get the puzzle going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things can&amp;rsquo;t all be right.  Unless you have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; on your mind.  Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  Then, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is logically equivalent to (either (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) or (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;)).  So, your regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; means that you also regret that (either (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) or (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;)), by the &lt;em&gt;equivalence prinicple&lt;/em&gt;. By the &lt;em&gt;disjunction principle&lt;/em&gt;, you either regret (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) or you regret (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;).  Suppose, without loss of generality, that it&amp;rsquo;s (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;).  Now (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) is equivalent to ((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) or (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  So by the &lt;em&gt;eqiuvalence principle&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;  You see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a version of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=slingshot+argument&#34;&gt;slingshot argument&lt;/a&gt; for regrets.  Clearly, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe the equivalence thesis (in its classical guise, at least) and the disjunction thesis for regrets.  I&amp;rsquo;ve argued &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ten&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;favour&lt;/em&gt; of the disjunction thesis and &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; classical equivalence for &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ten&#34;&gt;truthmakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should we think in this case?  Are either of the equivalence or the disjunction theses plausible?  I&amp;rsquo;ve got my own ideas but I&amp;rsquo;ve written enough for one night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to Robert Anderson for getting me thinking about regrets and disjunctions and proposing something like the disjunction thesis.  He thought of it when worrying about bets and regrets and Lloyd Humberstone&amp;rsquo;s puzzle &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/04/20/on_the_cable_guy_paradox/&#34;&gt;mentioned in the previous post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the Cable Guy Paradox</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/04/20/on_the_cable_guy_paradox/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/04/20/on_the_cable_guy_paradox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Have you ever waited for a tradesperson to come to your place? &lt;a href=&#34;http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/people-defaults/alanh/index.php3&#34;&gt;Alan H&amp;aacute;jek&lt;/a&gt; uses this example in an article entitled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/591815&#34;&gt;The Cable Guy Paradox&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  The issue is straightforward.  You and I are waiting for the cable guy who has given you a window between 8am and 4pm for his arrival.  He will arrive &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; 8am, and &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; 4pm.  We while away our time with a bet.  Before 8am, we bet on whether he&amp;rsquo;ll come in the morning or the afternoon.  It seems that there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to choose between the interval (8am,12noon) and (12noon,4pm).  (Let&amp;rsquo;s assume, with H&amp;aacute;jek that it&amp;rsquo;s probability zero that the moment of arrival is 12noon &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;.)  It&amp;rsquo;s equally likely that he arrive in the morning and in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there seems to be an asymmetry.  H&amp;aacute;jek cites the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Avoid Certain Frustration Principle&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you now have a choice between two options. You should not choose one of these options if you are certain that a rational future self of yours will prefer that you had chosen the other one &amp;ndash; unless both your options have this property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H&amp;aacute;jek seems that using this principle, we should bet on the &lt;em&gt;afternoon&lt;/em&gt; and not the &lt;em&gt;morning&lt;/em&gt;, since whenever the cable guy arrives, it will be &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; 8am (we specified that in the setup of the problem), so the will be some interval of time (8 am, 8+&amp;#x03B5; am) during which I will take the probability of the &lt;em&gt;morning&lt;/em&gt; arrival to be something smaller than the probability of the &lt;em&gt;afternoon&lt;/em&gt; arrival, and I will regret my choice for the bet if I had chosen morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paper, H&amp;aacute;jek uses this example to motivate a rejection and revision of the &lt;em&gt;Avoid Certain Frustration Principle&lt;/em&gt;.  I think that rejecting this principle seems sound, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this example shows it.  Here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that in this case I am &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; to be frustrated.  For I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that there is, in fact, an interval of time where I will regret making the bet.  First, the bet might be cancelled for some reason &amp;ndash; the guy might arrive &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt;, contrary to his promise.  More interestingly, we might decide to go out and leave someone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; to mind the house, only to return after 4pm.  In that case, at any time after 8am, I don&amp;rsquo;t know that the guy hasn&amp;rsquo;t arrived, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have the same grounds for regret.  So, I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ll have my regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite example, however, is this one: I don&amp;rsquo;t know that you won&amp;rsquo;t mug me, put me in the cupboard and mind the house without my company.  Furthermore, you might record the front door with your camera, and then, after 4pm, let me out, and play the recording &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt;.  In that case, there&amp;rsquo;s some interval of time in which I&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; having chosen the morning rather than the afternoon, by completely symmetric reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t see how I can be &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ll be frustrated with my &lt;em&gt;morning&lt;/em&gt; bet in the sense required by H&amp;aacute;jek.  (He&amp;rsquo;s very careful to distinguish certain frustration from &lt;em&gt;very likely&lt;/em&gt; frustration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned this to a number of people.  I mentioned it to Alan H&amp;aacute;jek at the 2004 AAP conference at which he presented the paper.  I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about it with some students here at Melbourne who&amp;rsquo;ve been worrying about this issue.  My line doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to convince &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; accept me.  Why is that? If you think it&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant to the considerations in the paper, or if there&amp;rsquo;s a way to reconfigure the example to make my worries not apply, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and on other counterexamples to the &lt;em&gt;Avoid Certain Frustration Principle&lt;/em&gt;?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/phil/department/humberstone/&#34;&gt;Lloyd Humberstone&lt;/a&gt; mentioned this scenario to me today, which is in his &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/591843&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll Regret It&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  The scenario goes like this.  You&amp;rsquo;re going to bet $&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; on a horse in the Melbourne Cup.  If the horse loses, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret having made the bet.  If the horse wins, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret not betting &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than $&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.  In either case, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret having bet $&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; on the horse.  Isn&amp;rsquo;t that cute? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that this is a completely convincing counterexample to the principle, but it bears thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masses of Formal Philosophy: Question 1</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/04/19/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_1/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/03/03/masses_of_formal_philosophy/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about Vincent Hendricks and John Symons&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/Masses/index.html&#34;&gt;five questions about &lt;em&gt;Formal Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This seems like as good a place as any to answer them.  So, today, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a crack at the most autobiographical of the questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-were-you-initially-drawn-to-formal-methods&#34;&gt;Why were you initially drawn to formal methods?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the natural way to interpret this question is something like &amp;ldquo;why do formal methods rather than anything else in philosophy&amp;rdquo; but in my case I&amp;rsquo;d rather answer the related question &amp;ldquo;why, given that you&amp;rsquo;re interested in formal methods, apply them in philosophy rather than elsewhere.&amp;rdquo;  I started off my academic life as an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;undergraduate student in mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, because I was good at mathematics and studying it more seemed like a good idea at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed mathematics a great deal.  At the University of Queensland, where I was studying, there was a special cohort of &amp;ldquo;Honours&amp;rdquo; students right from the first year.  You were taught more research-oriented and rigourous subjects than were provided for the &amp;ldquo;Pass&amp;rdquo; students.  This meant that we had a small cohort of students, who knew each other pretty well, studied together and learned a lot.  I could see myself making an academic career in mathematics. (I surely couldn&amp;rsquo;t see myself doing anything other than an academic career.  Being around the university was too much fun.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was a fly in the ointment.  I was doing well in my studies, but I was losing the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; for a great deal of the mathematics I was doing.  Applied mathematics went first, and analysis soon after.  I could do the work, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; it.  I wrote assignments by matching patterns from what I had written in my lecture notes, or what was in the text with what we were asked.  In exams, I just bashed away at the problem, sometimes when asked in an exam to prove that &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d work at &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; from the top of a page and keep manipulating it until I&amp;rsquo;d got stuck.  Then I&amp;rsquo;d work &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, hoping to meet at somewhere rather like where I&amp;rsquo;d got stuck.  If I was honest, I&amp;rsquo;d write &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to get from here to there&amp;rdquo;.  If I was dishonest, I&amp;rsquo;d just leave the transition unexplained.  Knowing what I know now about marking assignments, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t suprise me that I did very well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas where intuition and understanding lasted the longest (and which were most &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;) were topology, probability theory, combinatorics, set theory and logic.  There were so few honours subjects I really &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to do that in my last year I struck a deal with the mathematics department that I could do a reading course in logic with the newly arrived professor in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uq.edu.au/hprc/index.html?page=19718&#34;&gt;Philosophy Department&lt;/a&gt;. The professor was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#graham&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt;, and the reading course was my introduction to philosophical logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very same time as I was wondering how to continue with academic life, I was very involved in Christian student things: in the little group I was in, I ran study groups, I organised meetings, I wrote publicity material, and I did a &lt;em&gt;bucketload&lt;/em&gt; of reading.  In particular, while trying to figure out what I believed about things (about a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things), I read a lot of philosophy of religion and other philosophy written by Christians.  I found the philosophy more interesting, more rigourous and more accessible than a great deal of the &lt;em&gt;theology&lt;/em&gt; I had been reading.  This piqued my interest in doing more philosophy for myself.  I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done much philosophy as an undergraduate (just two subjects), but I started trying to figure out how to do a major in Philosophy quickly, so that I could go on to postgraduate work in that field, rather than in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that my work with Graham Priest went so well that I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do more undergraduate study in Philosophy to start postgraduate work.  (That semester course resulted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, my first genuine academic publication.) I was offered a place in the Ph.D. program on the strength of my background in mathematics.  I was free to pursue my interest in philosophy, and logic was the bridge.  This meant that I could use the formal, mathematical skills that I had learned, on topics that interested me, and that I &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt;.  The mathematics was simple and manageable, it was applied to interesting issues, and I got to hang around with philosophers, who are interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Happy fifth birthday, Z!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it&amp;rsquo;s unwrapping presents, a quiet family breakfast and lego-making, talking to grand-dad on the telephone, a little practice on the new bike, some school, and dinner together with more fiddling around with the new presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Party&lt;/em&gt; is on Saturday.  (Wish us luck. We&amp;rsquo;ve not hosted a fifth birthday party before.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Well, that was easy...</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sometimes technologies can be use for purposes the inventors didn&amp;rsquo;t really intend.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure that when the designers of the iTunes music store set the thing up, they didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that you&amp;rsquo;d be able to use it to download esoteric papers in philosophical logic.  But you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=138002605&amp;s=143460&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/consequentlyorg_in_itunes.png&#34; alt=&#34;consequently.org/writing in iTunes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I had to do was submit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS feed of my papers&lt;/a&gt; to the iTunes store &lt;a href=&#34;https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/publishPodcast&#34;&gt;on this form&lt;/a&gt;, after tweaking it to include the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/techspecs.html&#34;&gt;information that the iTunes store is looking for&lt;/a&gt;.  A day later, there it is.  Now you can use iTunes to automatically download any papers I write.  (Though, you can&amp;rsquo;t yet get them automatically downloaded onto your iPod for you to read, as the iPod doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a pdf reader &amp;ndash; at least not yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works since iTunes knows what to do with pdf files: if you buy tracks from the music store with lyrics or booklets, they can come as pdf files, which iTunes can store and hand over to your system to display.  My &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; that I use to serve up pointers to my recent publications has the same general structure as the feeds used in podcasting.  The difference is that my publications feed just contained pointers to webpages on which you could download pdf files, while podcasting feeds contain &lt;em&gt;enclosures&lt;/em&gt; of pdf files.  It was simple enough to tweak the feed to link to the pdf files directly as enclosures.  I did that &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/04/02/enclosures&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.  Then I submitted the feed to iTunes and here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=138002605&amp;amp;s=143460&#34;&gt;link to the me on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;.  Notice that the site features customer reviews.  Why don&amp;rsquo;t you write one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you publish papers online and would like people to get your stuff as conveniently as possible, then feel free to a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;my RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt; and use that as a template for your own.  As far as I can tell, using iTunes in this way is just a bit of a joke. (It gives me a laugh to see the feed appearing there, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect people to come across it very much or for those that do get to it that way to know what to do with it.) However, using feeds to enable subcriptions to documents, whether mp3 files, pdf files or anything else, will only become more prevalent in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next job is to enable feedreading for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;Australasian Journal of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  That will require a fair bit of work.  Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m just handcoding the site. I&amp;rsquo;m awaiting the OK from the &lt;em&gt;Powers That Be&lt;/em&gt; for us to use some software on the server to facilitate more interesting communication (feeds for subscribing to papers, and comments on articles) for the journal.  I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know here when the system is in place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Su Rogerson has brought to my attention a lovely rendition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/&#34;&gt;Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;, due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp05320&#34;&gt;Peter Geach&lt;/a&gt;, in his &lt;em&gt;Reason and Argument&lt;/em&gt; (Blackwell, 1976), pages 93&amp;ndash;95.  The discussion takes place at a car yard.  I&amp;rsquo;ll quote the discussion, interspersed with some commentary.  (I&amp;rsquo;m quoting from a draft of Su Rogerson&amp;rsquo;s thesis, and not from the text.  I&amp;rsquo;ll check this for correctness when I have access to the volume.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if, if I buy the car, you&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might suspect that this claim of the customer&amp;rsquo;s is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the best starting point for a car purchase negotiation, and that rather too much is conceded straight away.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not quite right.  The customer has only conceded that the guarantee (conditional on the purchase) is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for the purchase, not sufficient.  (The claim is an &amp;lsquo;only if&amp;rsquo; not an &amp;lsquo;if&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that if you buy the car, then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it: what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Then I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the crucial concession.  It&amp;rsquo;s all downhill from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: Can I hold you to both the things you&amp;rsquo;ve just said?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer is going to regret saying that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: Then you are logically committed to buying the car anyhow, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: What?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salesman is being a bit disingenuous at this point, but what he says is literally true, as we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: You say you&amp;rsquo;ll by the car only on condition that if you buy the car I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Yes, I do say that: I&amp;rsquo;m not a complete idiot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: Well then: if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car, you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Uh-uh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But in logic &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is just a variant of &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;; so &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is equivalent to &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: What on earth has that got to do with my buying the car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of comments are worth making here.  (1) Beware of car salesmen who start spouting off dubious claims about logical equivalence. They&amp;rsquo;re up to something fishy.   (2) What on earth is the qualifier &amp;lsquo;in logic&amp;rsquo; doing in the salesman&amp;rsquo;s claim? Can&amp;rsquo;t the customer reply, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;in logic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m in a car yard trying to get out of my apparent commitment to buy this car&amp;rdquo;?  Surely it should be &amp;lsquo;in our study of logic, we&amp;rsquo;ve figured out that &amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; not some claim about what&amp;rsquo;s true &amp;lsquo;in logic&amp;rsquo; as that makes us wonder about if it&amp;rsquo;s true elsewhere.   (3) The claim that &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and is &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is highly dubious in general, but here we don&amp;rsquo;t need to consider he niceties of the semantics and pragmatics of conditionals.  We just simply need to note that both &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; entail the much weaker claim that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; materially implies &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; (that either &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true or &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t) and read all other instances of &amp;lsquo;if &amp;hellip; then&amp;rsquo; in the dialogue as material conditionals. (4) The inference principle appealed to by the salesman is the inference of &lt;em&gt;contraction&lt;/em&gt; (from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) to &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;).  Perhaps if the customer had read &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics/&#34;&gt;my thesis&lt;/a&gt; he or she might have had a chance at resisting the slide at this point.  But I doubt it.  (5) &lt;em&gt;This is a completely irrelevant aside&lt;/em&gt;. An exercise to the reader: Discuss whether or not it is, in fact, possible that a fictional character in a dialogue written in 1976 to read a Ph.D. thesis written nearly twenty years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On with the dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: You said that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car, then you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.  But that, you see, is logically equivalent to saying that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Never mind what is logically equivalent to what!  Will you guarantee the car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good objection.  Keep track of whether or not the salesman &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; addresses this point that the customer has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m not saying anything about that just now.  You said &amp;ndash; remember? &amp;ndash; that I can hold you to what you&amp;rsquo;ve said.  And you&amp;rsquo;ve as good as said that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Well, yes, it looks as if I did say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I am reminded of many Socratic dialogues, in which a hapless victim says &amp;ldquo;Well, yes, Socrates, it does appear that you&amp;rsquo;re right&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But you also said that, on condition that if you&amp;rsquo;ll but the car, I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it, you undertake you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Yes I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But you are logically committed, as we just saw, to saying that the condition you stipulated is fulfilled: namely, that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ndash; * &amp;ndash; ? * ! *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the customer says at this point, but it does seem to be not particularly polite.  If I were the customer, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thinking polite thoughts, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: So you&amp;rsquo;ve just got to buy the car, guarantee or no guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, either a sign of remarkable ignorance on the part of the salesman, or disingenuousness.  I leave it to you to decide which is the likelier explanation on the basis of the dialogue thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look at the customer&amp;rsquo;s next step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: But I said that I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if you&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.  So if I am going to buy the car &amp;ndash; as you pretend to have proved that I must &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ve got to guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha!  Good point.  Now, will the salesman address the issue of the guarantee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: I don&amp;rsquo;t have to accept that.  You said I could hold you to what you said: that&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.  I&amp;rsquo;m not bound by what you said, obviously.  So it&amp;rsquo;s a deal.  I see you have your Access card there, sir.  Thankyou very much, Sir. Please sign here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think?  Is the salesman as disingenuous as I have made out?  &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; the salesman have inferred that he will guarantee the car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a way to make that plausible.  As shifty as the saleseman appears, it does seem that he&amp;rsquo;s right.  He&amp;rsquo;s helping the customer  see the consequences of what she/he has said.  Nothing he says commits *him*self to those claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it does seem to me that if the customer is still committed to the promise, then she/he is still committed to concluding that the salesman will guarantee the car.  In the face of manifest evidence that the salesman will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; guarantee the car, then isn&amp;rsquo;t the appropriate thing to conclude that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case that the customer will buy the car if and only if he/she will buy the car only if there&amp;rsquo;s a guarantee?  That is, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the customer take back the claim, or the conditional &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; to buy the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this actually breaking a commitment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think so, since the commitment has a factual consequence.  (If the commitment is &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; then the guarantee is made).  It&amp;rsquo;s as if I promise to bring wash up after you cook dinner tonight.  If you decide &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to cook dinner tonight, then there&amp;rsquo;s nothing I can do to wash up after you cook dinner.    It was a silly promise to make, as meeting is beyond my control. Circumstances can conspire to make it &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; (in those circumstances) for me to meet the promise.  Similarly in the salesman case.  If the customer is committed to seeing to it that he/she purchases the car if and only if, he/she purchases the car only if it is guaranteed, then a consequent commitment is to see to it that the guarantee is made.  If that&amp;rsquo;s outside the control of the customer, the commitment cannot be met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I reckon, the customer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t sign!  Don&amp;rsquo;t buy the car.  An especially, don&amp;rsquo;t trust car salesmen who appear to know a lot of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Su Rogerson for telling me about this wonderful dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that if you subscribe to my papers page using that feed, and you&amp;rsquo;re using an RSS reader that handles enclosures (this feature is primarily used for podcasts), then you can get it to download my papers automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the side effect that you can subscribe to me in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to neaten up this place a bit, and I need your help and advice.  Have a look &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/newindex.php&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think of it.  I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make it easier to see what&amp;rsquo;s new, what&amp;rsquo;s changed, etc.  In particular, you look &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; to find links to other new stuff on the site.  This opens up the sidebars for four things.  The most recent picture, my &amp;ldquo;recently browsed&amp;rdquo; linklist, my list of events (which I need to update) and finally, a very modest list of links to friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think?  Clearer?  Simpler?  Easier to understand?  Or not?  Does it break in your browser?  Leave a comment and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AJL Papers</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/30/ajl_papers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2006 10:44:34 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/30/ajl_papers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning I uploaded a few new papers to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;Australasian Journal of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, one of the projects I (mostly!) enjoy working on.  It&amp;rsquo;s an open access, fully refereed, online journal in logic.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve not seen it before, browse around and check it out.  Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that an online journals make possible is the freedom from constraints of filling a fixed number of fixed-size volumes a year.  Different ejournals do this differently.  At the AJL, we publish one volume per year, but papers appear in the volume whenever they complete the refereeing and editing process.  We close the volume at the end of the year, and start a new one in the next year.  This means that wherever one paper is in the queue doesn&amp;rsquo;t block the progress of any other paper.  We can publish Tony Roy&amp;rsquo;s massive 146 page &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/2006/index.html#3&#34;&gt;Natural Derivations for Priest &lt;em&gt;An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without worrying that this will delay the other things in the queue until the next volume.  Tony&amp;rsquo;s paper has meant that we&amp;rsquo;ve well-and-truly broken our pagecount record for the 2006 volume, and we&amp;rsquo;re only in March.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spooky coincidence? I think not</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/28/spooky_coincidence_i_think_not/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2006 20:42:07 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/28/spooky_coincidence_i_think_not/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today in &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt; I talked about vagueness and the sorites paradox.  Then when I get back to the office, I find that this Saturday, Alan Saunders on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/philosopher&#34;&gt;The Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone&lt;/a&gt; has a program on &amp;ndash; you guessed it &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/philosopher/stories/s1591158.htm&#34;&gt;the sorites paradox&lt;/a&gt;.  Is that a spooky coincidence or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not spooky.  It&amp;rsquo;s just a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, from the little outline, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that Saunders has a more adept journalistic sense of what can get a point across than me.  His example (is &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.google.com/images?q=bruce%20willis&#34;&gt;Bruce Willis&lt;/a&gt; bald?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.google.com/images?q=peter%20garrett&#34;&gt;Peter Garrett&lt;/a&gt; definitely is, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.google.com/images?q=billy%20connolly&#34;&gt;Billy Connolly&lt;/a&gt; definately isn&amp;rsquo;t, but what to say of Bruce?) is much nicer than my boring examples of strips of colour shading from red to yellow, or heaps of grains of sand or the other stock philosophical examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the class had a pretty energetic discussion, from people trying on different responses to the paradox, to other students pushing pretty hard on the &amp;ldquo;just stop doing logic if it produces problems like this&amp;rdquo; sort of line.  I like these sort of questions &amp;ndash; at least if they&amp;rsquo;re attempts to get to grips with the issues, as they seemed to be to me &amp;ndash; because they&amp;rsquo;re a sign that when you do something like logic, it&amp;rsquo;s our job to address the philosophical or interpretive issues of what is going on.  This is why I like doing the sorites paradox and vagueness around halfway through an intro course, as it gets to the heart of the issue of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing when we talk about truth values and the machinery of classical propositional logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after the class, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me if I did a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good job of addressing the issues that came up in the discussion.  So, my readers, it&amp;rsquo;s with some trepidation that I&amp;rsquo;m going to point you to the lectures for the subject.  They&amp;rsquo;re recorded and can be found online (at least, until next year when they&amp;rsquo;ll be overwritten or archived or somesuch).  If you can bear it (and have nothing better to do for 50 minutes or so), take a listen to the March 28 recording &lt;a href=&#34;http://harangue.lecture.unimelb.edu.au/ilectures/ilectures.lasso?skip=0&amp;amp;ut=589&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are the disclaimers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording starts with me asking if anyone has a nine volt battery.  The wireless microphone was dead, and needed a new battery.  A nice person from Teaching Space Services delivered the battery just as the lecture started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing on the whiteboard.  The people there can see it but you can&amp;rsquo;t.  I wrote down the form of a sorites argument, discussed in the last class (setting a series of colours, each apparently indistinguishable from the next, shading from what looks to red to what looks to yellow), what makes the thing a paradox (the premises seem true and the conclusion seems false and the argument seems valid), and some options for responding to the tension of the paradox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of questions from the class (good questions), but they don&amp;rsquo;t all get picked up from the recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sound &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; but that might just be my reaction to hearing my own voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the issue, or if you want to give me some feedback on this class, listen and post here.  If you are a &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/prot&#34;&gt;161-115&lt;/a&gt; student (I know some of you read this thing) please feel free to post comments too.   I&amp;rsquo;m up for getting tips on teaching.  Especially on dealing with questions from the floor.  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with how I dealt with all of the student questions, so tips and comments will be most helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oh, and there&#39;s another paper, too</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/28/oh_and_theres_another_paper_too/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/28/oh_and_theres_another_paper_too/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention that I have written another paper recently.  It&amp;rsquo;s a proof theory paper, putting down some thoughts on modal proof theory that I formulated when giving the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;S5 paper&lt;/a&gt; around and about in the last six months or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal/&#34;&gt;Comparing Modal Sequent Systems&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; I look at different ways to understand modal deduction.  In particular, I argue that you can understand &lt;em&gt;labelled&lt;/em&gt; proof systems &amp;ndash; those in which proofs consist of statements annotated with labels, often thought of as denoting &amp;lsquo;possible worlds&amp;rsquo; at least in modal proof theory &amp;ndash; can be reconceived in such a way as to not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; require talk of worlds.  When you play close attention to the kind of work done by the labels, it can be understood instead as a different representation of a &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; feature of modal deduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point in this paper is a technical one, but the moral is broader than that.  The view I argue for in the &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;Invention&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; paper feeds off this kind of point.  Properly &lt;em&gt;modal&lt;/em&gt; deduction involves doing new things in the structure of argument &amp;ndash; you can do a kind of &lt;em&gt;supposing&lt;/em&gt; (say, &amp;lsquo;hypothetical&amp;rsquo; supposing), which has its own interesting behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so I think, anyway.  In &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper I look the issue by way of a comparison between labelled deduction and display logic.  Display Logic is maligned for being complicated, but not for failing to be &amp;lsquo;structural.&amp;rsquo;  No-one accuses Display Logic of importing explicit talk possible worlds into proofs.  Labelled deduction is criticised for doing exactly that, but it has nice properties.  In the paper, I show how you can get from display logic to Labelled Deduction, and thereby get a new view on labelled modal systems, inheriting some of the &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; features of display logic, but which has its own kind of simplicity and charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a logician, I&amp;rsquo;d love to know what you think of it.  Download it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal&#34;&gt;leave a comment&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted it for presentation at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~aiml06/&#34;&gt;AiML 2006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey.  Look at that.  Two posts in one day.  Even with some philosophico-logical content.  I think I can make it three&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I truly am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the period 1990-1992, I wrote a couple of papers on the semantics of relevant logics.  I thought they were pretty nifty, and I submitted them to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&amp;amp;issn=0022-3611&#34;&gt;prestigious journal&lt;/a&gt;.  They got accepted.  The first of these papers is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/simpsem/&#34;&gt;Simplified Semantics for Relevant Logics (and some of their rivals)&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatley, there&amp;rsquo;s a hole in the middle of this paper.  That&amp;rsquo;s the problem with being a logician, people can sometimes &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; you wrong by presenting a counterexample to your claim.  That&amp;rsquo;s the nice thing about playing a game with relatively clear rules.  You can figure out what constitutes good play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cal.csusb.edu/Faculty/Philosophy/roy/&#34;&gt;Tony Roy&lt;/a&gt; did a fantastic job of isolating the problem, which exists in not only my paper, but Graham Priest&amp;rsquo;s text &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/052179434X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which followed the simplified semantics rather closely.   The problem is serious, for in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; semantics for the relevant logic  R, it turns out that disjunctive syllogism (the inference from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; v &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; and ~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is valid, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony isolated the problem, and we came up with a fix.  The result is the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/permutation&#34;&gt;On Permutation in Simplified Semantics&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  Please take a look over it before we sent it off to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and to the greater philosophical community (or at least, the tiny fraction that has come across this paper) &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for deceiving you.  I hope this paper helps make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little spot called Melbourne&lt;br /&gt;
Is the city of my birth&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not as hot as Brisbane&lt;br /&gt;
or as far away as Perth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not as small as Adelaide,&lt;br /&gt;
Compared to Canberra, it&amp;rsquo;s bliss,&lt;br /&gt;
And if you&amp;rsquo;ve been to Melbourne,&lt;br /&gt;
You can give Sydney a miss&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world gets scarier,&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty decent area&lt;br /&gt;
Melbourne&lt;br /&gt;
The envy of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://smh.com.au/news/commonwealth-games/melbourne-we-did-it/2006/03/26/1143330923113.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; was a knowing, self-reflective and ironic appropriation of Australian (and Melburnian) parochialism, but I&amp;rsquo;m not altogether sure about how the irony was received, given the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvguide.ninemsn.com.au/cu/default.asp?pid=14286318&#34;&gt;insipid television commentary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, anything a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Humphries&#34;&gt;72 year old bloke in drag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dame-edna.com/&#34;&gt;with purple hair&lt;/a&gt; who shot to fame (such fame as it was) knowingly making fun of Melbourne suburban life and other Australian attitudes can&amp;rsquo;t be all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Last Night at the MCG</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/25/last_night_at_the_mcg/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2006 08:40:25 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/25/last_night_at_the_mcg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Z and I &amp;ndash; together with around 80,000 other people &amp;ndash; filled the MCG to watch the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule+and+Results/By+Sport/Athletics?SelectedDate=Fri%2024%20Mar&#34;&gt;track and field portion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://melbourne2006.com/M2006/Daily+Summaries/Day+9&#34;&gt;Day 9&lt;/a&gt; of the Commonwealth Games here.  Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The completed renovations at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcg.org.au/&#34;&gt;MCG&lt;/a&gt; make the huge stadium very easy to navigate.  We got there early, so had no long queues to deal with (once we were at the ground itself &amp;ndash; it was another matter on the train network).  It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get in and out of the ground, the seats were comfortable, the view was good on Deck 2 of the Olympic Stand, and once the stadium filled up, you understood why the MCG is such a popular venue.  It fits &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many people, yet you feel very close to the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd was good-natured.  Much alcohol was consumed by some of our neighbours (the trip to the bar was very short, and repeatedly taken), but any drunks were quiet and happy drunks, not loud and angry ones.  We were, as a whole, terribly parochially Australian, but not without occasional flashes of appreciation for athletes of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One crowd favourite in the latter category was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=108139&#34;&gt;Sapolai Yao&lt;/a&gt;, the 1.52 metre tall distance runner from PNG who earned the appreciation of the crowd by enthusiastically completing the 3km steeplechase, &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; managing to hold off being lapped by the lead Kenyan runners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One crowd favourite in the other category were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=109976&#34;&gt;Steve Hooker&lt;/a&gt; who pole vaulted a Games&amp;rsquo; record.  He entred the competition with a jump at 5.6 metres, when most of the other competitors had failed to make that height or lower.  He flew over the bar and with his first jump it was obvious that he could go much higher.  He easily cleared 5.7 and 5.8, winning the Gold medal at 5.6 when the remaining competitor, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=110387&#34;&gt;Dmitri Markov&lt;/a&gt; failed at 5.7 and 5.75  He tried for a personal best of 6.01, but despite the crowd support, he didn&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other crowd heroes were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=110182&#34;&gt;Stuart Rendell&lt;/a&gt; who threw a games record in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Fri%2024%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT0054E0100001?ScheduleItemID=29054&#34;&gt;Hammer Throw&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=110268&#34;&gt;Bronwyn Thompson&lt;/a&gt; who set a new Games record in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Fri%2024%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT1061E0100001?ScheduleItemID=29066&#34;&gt;Long Jump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miscellaneous moments of drama: the Australian &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=110080&#34;&gt;Sally McLellan&lt;/a&gt; crashed &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the last hurdle in the Women&amp;rsquo;s 100m, to be disqualified.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=103859&#34;&gt;Marlon Devonish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=103885&#34;&gt;Mark Lewis-Francis&lt;/a&gt; from the English Men&amp;rsquo;s 4x100m relay team fluffed the baton change.  They weren&amp;rsquo;t very happy with that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nearly-five-year-old can have a wonderful time with a very late night, cheering madly, and looking gog-eyed at all of the people, all of the strange things they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and making his own plans for a future pole-vault career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these moments are captured in the photos from March on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam&#34;&gt;photo page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marathon Effort</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/19/marathon_effort/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2006 16:39:07 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/03/19/marathon_effort/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Z and I went in to the city to have a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Sun%2019%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT1099E0100001?ScheduleItemID=28953&#34;&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Sun%2019%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT0099E0100001?ScheduleItemID=28935&#34;&gt;Men&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Marathon held here for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/&#34;&gt;2006 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;.  The city was buzzing, the crowds friendly, and it was great to get a glimpse of the lead runners: especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Kerryn%20McCann%20and%20Hellen%20Cheron%20Koskei,%20Commonwealth%20Games%20Marathon,%20Alexandra%20Gardens,%20March%2019,%202006.jpg&#34;&gt;Kerryn McCann and Hellen Cherono Koskei&lt;/a&gt; who raced neck-and-neck right into the stadium.  No matter how you cut it, 42+ kilometres is a long way to run.  I suppose the task is quite literally, a &lt;em&gt;marathon&lt;/em&gt; effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C arrived with lunch when the marathon had finished, and our afternoon was wrapped up with some great live music from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Festival+Melbourne2006/Performances/profiles/Ravi+Bandhu+Vidyapathy.htm&#34;&gt;Ravi Bandhu Vidyapathy&lt;/a&gt; and friends from Sri Lanka, at the Festival site down at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Festival+Melbourne2006/Locations/Alexandra+Gardens.htm&#34;&gt;Alexandra Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.  Even for people who have a middling interest in sport, like me, the Commonweath Games has brought its own kind of spark into the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for Friday night, when Z and I head down to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule+and+Results/By+Sport/Athletics?SelectedDate=Fri%2024%20Mar&#34;&gt;athletics at the MCG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masses of Formal Philosophy</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Vincent Hendricks and John Symons are working on a sequel to their book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/&#34;&gt;Formal Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, in which philosophers who use &amp;ldquo;formal methods&amp;rdquo; talked about their work, their motivations, and their take on the state of philosophy.  For the sequel, they are opening things up for others to take an &amp;ldquo;interview&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/Masses/index.html&#34;&gt;five questions&lt;/a&gt;, to appear in the next book, &lt;em&gt;Masses of Formal Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the criteria Vincent and John are using for selecting answers for appearing in the book &amp;ndash; but I am thinking about their five questions.  Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why were you initially drawn to formal methods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What example(s) from your work (or the work of others) illustrates the role formal methods can play in philosophy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the proper role of philosophy in relation to other disciplines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you consider the most neglected topics and/or contributions in late 20th century philosophy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the most important open problems in philosophy and what are the prospects for progress?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These look like interesting questions to think about.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll post some draft answers here first, for feedback, and if I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the result, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it off to Vincent and John for consideration.  If you work in this area, you might consider doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Does it sound like a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Degrees of Truth, Degrees of Falsity</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/02/19/degrees_of_truth_degrees_of_falsity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2006 08:57:49 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/02/19/degrees_of_truth_degrees_of_falsity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Toby Ord (a former student of mine, now taking Oxford by storm), has written up a nice short essay on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/degrees/&#34;&gt;degrees of truth and degrees of falsity&lt;/a&gt;.  It shows how you can get a very nice little algebra if you extend the usual non-classical idea of a 4-valued logic in which truth and falsity are somewhat independent with the &amp;ldquo;fuzzy&amp;rdquo; idea of degrees of truth between zero and one. Both ideas have a heritage.  The idea of considering the interval [0,1] as a lattice of truth values goes back to &amp;#321;ukasiewicz, and the four-valued algebra, now known as BN4, traces back at least to some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/123362&#34;&gt;early work by Mike Dunn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby considers nice properties of this little algebra.  It seems to me that a good exercise for someone who likes fiddling with concrete algebras would be this: define a conditional &amp;rarr; on the algebra such that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when restricted to the fuzzy interval [0,1] it agrees with &amp;#321;ukasiewicz&amp;rsquo;s conditional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when restricted to the values &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; agrees with the usual BN4 conditional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has as many natural properties as possible.  In particular, defining &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; fuse &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; as ~(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; ~&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) gives an associative and commutative operator, and fusion is connected with the conditional by means of the usual residuation postulates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do this, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a nice concrete lattice which is a model for multiplicative and additive linear logic (and a little bit more &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s distributive), and I&amp;rsquo;ll have a nice example to talk about in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/HB/subjects/161-212.html&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, please go and read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/degrees/&#34;&gt;Toby&amp;rsquo;s Essay&lt;/a&gt;, complete my exercise, and let me know what you come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally joined the ranks of the zombies with white earbuds.  My trusty 2GB black &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ipodnano&#34;&gt;iPod nano&lt;/a&gt; was acquired on the way home from our Sabbatical, in a duty free store at Changi Airport.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had a little while to experiment with it, and so far, it&amp;rsquo;s been working better than I&amp;rsquo;d expected.  I take it with me on my early morning walks, sometimes listening to spoken word things and sometimes listening to music.  My taste in podcasts is &lt;a href=&#34;http://theblog.philosophytalk.org/2006/01/the_best_of_phi.html&#34;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lnl/&#34;&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I seem to treat this as time-shifted radio, rather than anything more cutting-edge.  However, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty mind-bending that you can get &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dur.ac.uk/kevin.bywater/&#34;&gt;esoteric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/conferences/Brandom-2005.htm&#34;&gt;seminars&lt;/a&gt; off the web, so academic seminars I&amp;rsquo;m interested in but didn&amp;rsquo;t go to can be downloaded onto my computer and put on the iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fun seeing how to get my middling sized (20+GB) music collection into my very svelte (2GB) iPod.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how I do that, read on.   It&amp;rsquo;s a long post, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like doing anything else this evening as I&amp;rsquo;ve sprained my ankle and I&amp;rsquo;m lying down giving my foot a rest.  It&amp;rsquo;s just the time to write a long blog post you&amp;rsquo;ve been ruminating on for a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executive summary goes like this: you can live really well with a small iPod, and the &amp;ldquo;smart playlists&amp;rdquo; in iTunes help you get a nice mix of unpredictability and choice in keeping your iPod fed with music.  Oh, and knowing some elementary logic helps too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;rsquo;s the story.  Hold on for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aim is to load up my iPod with music and other audio I want to listen to at the moment; podcasts I&amp;rsquo;m subscribing to; stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to recently but &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;, and stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve recently ripped from a CD or downloaded from one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://3hive.com&#34;&gt;free, legal MP3 sites on the web&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t like just listening to a big random &lt;em&gt;mush&lt;/em&gt; of stuff on my computer, so just loading a random selection of material from iTunes onto the iPod doesn&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just listen to the things &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; choose to put on the machine either.  If I were to do that, I&amp;rsquo;d just cycle through my favourites like I do with my CD collection.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a computer here, and computers are good at &lt;em&gt;computing&lt;/em&gt;, so I may as well use some of this computational power to figure out some of what I can listen to.   I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the synchronicity of new stuff bubbling up out of the mix as well as what I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen.  So, I wanted to find a way to mix choice and serendipity.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set up iTunes to sync some of the playlists on my computer to the iPod.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the setting in the preferences for iTunes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/itunes/ipod_playlist_settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;playlist settings in iTunes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set the system up to sync playlists to sync &lt;em&gt;nine&lt;/em&gt; of my playlists onto the iPod.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of playlists in the sidebar of the iTunes window.  I&amp;rsquo;ve filed them away in the &amp;ldquo;* iPod Management&amp;rdquo; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/itunes/list_of_playlists.png&#34; alt=&#34;list of playlists&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much work to manage nine playlists each time I wanted to fill my iPod up with music, but this works, since all but one of the playlists is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://smartplaylists.com/&#34;&gt;smart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (they&amp;rsquo;re the purple playlists, with gear on the icon).  iTunes updates the playlist and chooses music on the basis of criteria that you set up.  If I want to choose music to put on the iPod, it goes in the (you guessed it) &amp;ldquo;Choices&amp;rdquo; playlist.  I&amp;rsquo;ve named it with a reminder that I should put around 1GB on there.  (If I put any more on, my playlists will overfill my iPod, and iTunes will tell me that not everything will fit.)   It&amp;rsquo;s usually in the &amp;ldquo;Choices&amp;rdquo; playlist that I put entire albums that I&amp;rsquo;m listening to, or talks I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded that I want to listen to, then file away or delete. This is pretty standard, I suppose.  It&amp;rsquo;s 1GB of my 2GB iPod: It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more than a half of its storage for sound, as I store a few photos (around 186 at the moment: my five star photos from my collection) and my calendar too.  This other stuff takes up a few megabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; playlists that do the work in getting stuff on the iPod automatically.  Four of these playlists collect files to put on the iPod. Two of them (&lt;em&gt;Not Recent 4 Stars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Not Recent 5 stars&lt;/em&gt;) choose highly rated songs that I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to lately.  They&amp;rsquo;re smart playlists with the following conditions.  First, the 5-star playlist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Rating&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;five stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;266MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;least recently played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the 4-star playlist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Rating&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;four stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;100MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;least recently played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the playlists &lt;em&gt;Choices&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Not Recent 4 Stars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Not Recent 5 Stars&lt;/em&gt; are disjoint.  No track can appear on more than one of these playlists.   So we have around 1.36GB on the iPod so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two playlists select music I like (not Spoken Word stuff, and not Kids&amp;rsquo; music &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t want tracks from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thewiggles.com.au&#34;&gt;The Wiggles&lt;/a&gt; to appear on my iPod without my foreknowledge!  I just put them on in the &amp;ldquo;Choices&amp;rdquo; playlist if we&amp;rsquo;re giving the iPod to Zachary on a long drive or flight or something).  These playlists select more 5-star tracks than 4-star tracks, as I like 5-star tracks more than 4-star tracks.  (At least, when I rate something 5-star, I mean &amp;ldquo;this is really great &amp;ndash; I could listen to this again and again and again, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine getting bored of this&amp;rdquo; and when I rate something 4-star, I mean &amp;ldquo;this is a great track &amp;ndash; I want to listen to this again regularly.&amp;rdquo;)  So, &lt;em&gt;ratings&lt;/em&gt; help make this system work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do &lt;em&gt;playcounts&lt;/em&gt;.  iTunes keeps track of two pieces of information for every track &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;how many times it&amp;rsquo;s been played&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;when it was last played&lt;/em&gt;.  The really cool feature is that playcount information is copied from the iPod into iTunes each time you
sync the iPod.  This means that if I&amp;rsquo;m playing a track through iTunes at home or at work, or through my iPod when I&amp;rsquo;m on the move, iTunes is keeping track of that. So, things not recently played are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; not recently played.  (We recently acquired an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/&#34;&gt;AirPort Express&lt;/a&gt; which means that I can play from iTunes through our sound system at home.  It&amp;rsquo;s really neat!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other playlists help me get things rated.  First, &lt;em&gt;Unrated Most Played&lt;/em&gt; selects tracks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Rating&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;empty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;82MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;most often played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These get tracks that are unrated onto the iPod. When I listen to an unrated track on the iPod, I try to rate it when I first play it.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t rate songs much before getting the iPod.  Now it chooses unrated songs, in order of frequency played.  Notice that the tracks on this playlist cannot be in any of the other playlists so far, so now we have around 1.44GB on the iPod.  No more, but probably a little bit less because of rounding (if I limit to 82MB, it&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;em&gt;upper&lt;/em&gt; limit &amp;ndash; at the moment I write this, the playlist has 78.6MB worth of tracks, not 82MB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the rest of the music on the iPod?  The last playlist in this batch chooses recent stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playcount&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Not recent 4 Stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Not recent 5 Stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;300MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;most recently added&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently added into iTunes, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet played.  This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; necessarily disjoint with the other playlists (exercise for the reader: find the circumstances in which a track is on this playlist and another one on the iPod &amp;ndash; that should tell you why I don&amp;rsquo;t care about this happening).  It puts things I&amp;rsquo;ve recently added to iTunes into the iPod, for listening and rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is around 1.74GB (usually less than 1.65GB, with all that approximation) of stuff on the iPod. But I can fit more than that on a 2GB iPod, even with photos and calendars.  The rest is the &lt;em&gt;Podcasts&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve subscribed to and decided to upload into the iPod.  Here, I subscribe to a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/default.htm&#34;&gt;ABC Radio National&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rrr.org.au/byteintoit/&#34;&gt;Triple R&lt;/a&gt; (community radio based here in Melbourne) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://theblog.philosophytalk.org/2006/01/the_best_of_phi.html#more&#34;&gt;Philosophy Talk&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s nice that some programs (like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/services/podcasting.htm&#34;&gt;ABC&amp;rsquo;s podcasts&lt;/a&gt;) tell you the approximate filesize of their podcasts, which helps people like me who sync one episode from each subscription to an iPod.  This way I can tell that podcasts take up around 100MB, so my playlists won&amp;rsquo;t take my iPod over the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s how tracks get on the iPod.  The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; playlists help me access these tracks.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how they fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/itunes/playlist_chart.png&#34; alt=&#34;playlist chart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Everything&amp;rdquo; playlist contains everything on the five playlists I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned.   (It&amp;rsquo;s a smart playlist just selecting the stuff on the other playlists.)  It&amp;rsquo;s there because I use it to construct my other playlists.  Two are simple.  &lt;em&gt;?Unrated&lt;/em&gt; selects tracks from &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that are yet to be rated.  &lt;em&gt;!Hits&lt;/em&gt; selects tracks from &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that are rated four or five stars.  Sometimes I want to listen to the 4- and 5-star tracks, chosen at random.  This is for when I want to enjoy some music and not particularly worry about &lt;em&gt;evaluating&lt;/em&gt; it.  Sometimes I want to evaluate things (I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a tram and I want to rate some more of my music so that it&amp;rsquo;s in &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo;), so I use the &lt;em&gt;?Unrated&lt;/em&gt; playlist. (The punctuation marks &amp;ldquo;!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; put these playlists at the top of the list in the iPod.)  Finally, when I&amp;rsquo;m working and I want to listen to music, most often I want music &lt;em&gt;without words&lt;/em&gt;, which would compete with the words I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write.  So, &lt;em&gt;Instrumental&lt;/em&gt; picks out tracks from &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that contain the string &amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo; in the comments field.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got around to tagging 50% of my music as &amp;ldquo;Vocal&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo;, so this is not yet complete.  At the moment &amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo; on the iPod contains 500MB of music, chiefly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=consequentlyorg&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0000042HV%2Fqid%3D1139043132%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dclassical%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D5174&#34;&gt;late Shostakovich String Quartets&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=consequentlyorg&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00002EPJH%2F&#34;&gt;Keith Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=consequentlyorg&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00006EXHT%2F&#34;&gt;Anouar Brahem&lt;/a&gt;, lasting more than 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s the system.  It seems to work for me.  I get new stuff on the iPod each time I sync (mostly, if I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to anything or rated anything) and I have control over what I put on it as well.  It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of control and serendipity.  When I&amp;rsquo;ve rated more things on the iPod, I can modify the sizes on the playlists to suit, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the general scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little familiarity with classical propositional logic helps when constructing smart playlists.  They&amp;rsquo;ll be an example when I teach first-year &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt; this year. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice thing to think about: if a single condition on a playlist is a propositional literal, and a smart playlist is a conjunction or disjunction of literals, then what is a track in your library?  Is the playlist &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; rich enough to discriminate between &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; two tracks?  Can it construct arbitrary boolean combinations of the conditions?  (&lt;em&gt;Exercise to the reader&lt;/em&gt;.  What happen when you set up two playlists in iTunes: &lt;em&gt;Playlist A&lt;/em&gt; contains tracks on &lt;em&gt;Playlist B&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Playlist B&lt;/em&gt; contains tracks &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Playlist A&lt;/em&gt;.  That is, what is Apple&amp;rsquo;s account of the liar paradox?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five rating stars are a little bit &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than I need.  I mostly &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the music I have on my iPod, and I have more 4-star tracks than tracks between 3 and 1 stars.  I have tried to be more discriminating (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jwz.livejournal.com/578440.html&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/2006/01/stars.html&#34;&gt;guys&lt;/a&gt;, but my judgements about music seem to be much more context-relative than linear.  My preference ranking between (1) a Keith Jarrett rendition of a jazz standard, (2) a movement of a Shostakovich string quartet, (3) a grand performance of the last movement of Beethoven&amp;rsquo;s 9th, (4) Bruce Cockburn singing with righteous indignation and finger-picking skill, and (5) a finely structured minimalist piece by Arvo P&amp;auml;rt simply &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; linearizable beyond selecting them all as either &lt;em&gt;hmm, OK&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; (and, I suppose &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t tend to rip irredemably bad stuff into iTunes if I can help it).   A track can be great without being great-to-play-all-the-time, and I let my &amp;ldquo;skip track&amp;rdquo; finger do the talking when I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood for that &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of musical greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playcounts and last-played dates are just &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt;.  Since most of the music I play flows through iTunes, the database has a good representation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to.  This is one reason to prefer an &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/ipodnano&#34;&gt;iPod nano&lt;/a&gt; over an &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/ipodshuffle&#34;&gt;iPod shuffle&lt;/a&gt;.  A shuffle will update your &lt;em&gt;playcounts&lt;/em&gt; if you set it to sync, but since the little thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clock, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t update the information about when the track wasn&amp;rsquo;t last played.  Without that, the whole thing won&amp;rsquo;t work.  We were tossing up between getting a shuffle and getting a nano, and this (together with the gorgeous screen, and the fact that 1GB shuffles weren&amp;rsquo;t available in London, Oxford or Singapore when I was looking) was enough to tip the balance for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/01/05/dos_and_donts_&#34;&gt;what you need to do to make a viable competitor to the iPod and iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mention the ease of getting music (and other stuff) onto the player.  This is where the whole Apple thing works so well.  It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get stuff onto the iPod, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to navigate through it when it&amp;rsquo;s on there, and the information you can use (ratings, playcounts, etc.) is kept and made accessible. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing that is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to use &amp;ndash; both at an elementary level and also a sophisticated one &amp;ndash; and the other media players I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at have nothing to match it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now approach my music in a new way.  I&amp;rsquo;m listening to old stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to lately, and I&amp;rsquo;m actually weeding &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; from my music library stuff I&amp;rsquo;ll never listen to again, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking myself the question: is this good enough to listen to again?  I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying my music more, as I can be surprised by an old friend or make a new musical acquaintance on the tram on the way to work, or taking a morning walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to eke out &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the space on the iPod.  The more playlists you have like mine, the more the rounding-off adds up and you are left with a little bit of space on the iPod &amp;ndash; maybe enough for two or three or more tracks, but it depens on what is  on each of the playlists.  You could optimise this by limiting playlists not by a set amount, but by an amount which is some function of the size of other playlists.  (Instead of getting 300MB of music, get 400MB minus the size of the &amp;ldquo;Podcasts&amp;rdquo; playlist, for example.)  That would satisfy my sense of frugality and elegance, but, alas, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a way of designing a user interface for that which would make sense in the &lt;em&gt;Smart Playlists&lt;/em&gt; dialog so I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is the kind of thing Apple is going to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what I do at the moment.  Thanks to my cousin &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uts.edu.au/fac/edu/ostaff/staff/peter_devries.html&#34;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, who asked me how I used my iPod.  (Peter asks this kind of question &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uts.edu.au/fac/edu/ostaff/staff/peter_devries.html&#34;&gt;for a living&lt;/a&gt;.) This is the long, &lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; explanation of the &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt;.  After  I&amp;rsquo;ve used it some more, I might post again about how my relationship to the music (and to the other podcast audio) has developed and changed with more experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use an iPod or something like it, how do you manage it?  What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assorted crosscultural observations, upon visiting the supermarket</title>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2006/01/04/assorted_crosscultural_observations_upon_visiting_the_supermarket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning found Z and me in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coles.com.au/&#34;&gt;grocery store&lt;/a&gt;, doing yet more re-stocking of the pantry.  Here are some hastily selected observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic and fairtrade food has &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; higher market presence in the UK than in Australia.  Our nearest &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shoppingandservices/storelocator/searchresults.htm?query=ox2+8jj&#34;&gt;Sainsbury&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; more organic products than can be found in either of the two &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coles.com.au/&#34;&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolworths.com.au/&#34;&gt;chains&lt;/a&gt; here in Australia.  In our local supermarket, the paltry selection of organic products is filed away in the small &amp;ldquo;health food&amp;rdquo; section, than distributed through the relevant parts of the shop.  This makes comparison with other products difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s much more fresh food available in Australia, and correspondingly fewer pre-prepared meals.  Don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started talking about that UK phenomenon &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iceland.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. No, it does not feature Icelandic cuisine&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pauls.com.au/products/brands_details.cfm?/section/2/cid/1/pid/1/&#34;&gt;2 Litre plastic milk bottle&lt;/a&gt; looks very odd once you&amp;rsquo;ve been buying milk in the UK for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, my readers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve landed in Melbourne (to a hot 8pm at around 42 degrees Celcius), and are slowly reconstructing our household bit by bit.  The internet connection seems to work at least.  We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to change lightbulbs, unpack bags, look at a bit of our large pile of mail, get the boy to bed (and even to sleep) and have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yakun.com/&#34;&gt;Kaya Toast&lt;/a&gt; for a midnight or New Year snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you later in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About to leave Oxford</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/12/16/about_to_leave_oxford/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2005 12:22:40 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/12/16/about_to_leave_oxford/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of packing up our Oxford home, to start the short trip back.  We land in Melbourne on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, after some stops in K&amp;ouml;ln (for the Christmas Markets), Augsburg (for Christmas with friends), Frankfurt Airport (to get on the plane), Singapore (to break the journey, and give us some summer in close proximity to air conditioning before landing in the Melbourne summer heat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s too much to say in the limited time I&amp;rsquo;ve got online here, but here&amp;rsquo;s just a taste of what&amp;rsquo;s been going on.  Academic highlights in the last few weeks have involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambridge&lt;/em&gt;.  I zipped over to Cambridge on the bus (though &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mkweb.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Milton Keynes&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very strange city, at least when viewed from the window of a bus) for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/novmeeting.html&#34;&gt;CAMELEON workshop&lt;/a&gt; organised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/&#34;&gt;Tom Forster&lt;/a&gt;.  It was great to meet Tom, and also &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/&#34;&gt;Randall Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/Pure/staff/rathjen/rathjen.html&#34;&gt;Michael Rathjen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.colorado.edu/~almann/&#34;&gt;Allen Mann&lt;/a&gt; (who all presented papers), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/&#34;&gt;Martin Hyland&lt;/a&gt;, who gave me useful feedback on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;paper I presented&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris&lt;/em&gt;.  My &lt;a href=&#34;http://theoreme.blogspot.com/2005/12/greg-restall.html&#34;&gt;visit&lt;/a&gt; there was &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/&#34;&gt;IHSPT&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful place, with lots of nice people (a fantastic bunch of students who managed to make me eat my lunch or dinner very slowly by asking Interesting Questions and making me think Very Hard), together with a gorgeous city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Utrecht&lt;/em&gt;.  Where I enjoyed long conversations with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.let.uu.nl/~ctl/docenten/visser.html&#34;&gt;Albert Visser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.let.uu.nl/~ctl/docenten/moortgat.html&#34;&gt;Michael Moortgat&lt;/a&gt; and some of their students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine&amp;rsquo;s promotion (she&amp;rsquo;s now an Assoc. Prof. &lt;em&gt;and Reader&lt;/em&gt;, woohoo!) and her research fellowship (she now has five years of only as much undergraduate teaching as she wants to do).  Super!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And non-academically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maddy Prior &amp;amp; the Carnival Band: On Tuesday night, we managed to get some babysitting so Christine and I could hear Maddy Prior &amp;amp; the Carnival Band&amp;rsquo;s Oxford Christmas concert.  (Have you ever heard shawms playing reggae?  I hadn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking the streets of Paris, and spending an afternoon at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musee-orsay.fr/&#34;&gt;Muse&amp;eacute; D&amp;rsquo;Orsay&lt;/a&gt;.  There&amp;rsquo;s something humbling about wandering through an art gallery and seeing a masterpiece at every second step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing Zachary thrive:  He&amp;rsquo;s had a great time at the day nursery at Wolfson, and despite a recent bout of sickness (a cold when I was away in Utrecht last week), he&amp;rsquo;s been doing really well.  Once he got used to the cold weather, he&amp;rsquo;s adapted nicely, though like us, he&amp;rsquo;s keen to get back to Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s lots more to say, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to let it digest and post more comments on my thoughts when I&amp;rsquo;ve got more regular internet access (i.e., I&amp;rsquo;m at home) and I&amp;rsquo;ve given the thoughts time to settle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve given my two talks here in St. Andrews, with really useful discussion in both of the talks.  In the philosophy talk, questions ranged from matters of meaning theory, metaphysics and epistemology of possibility and necessity. Thanks especially to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~dpn/&#34;&gt;Daniel Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~csj6/&#34;&gt;Carrie Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~arche/pages/personal/rossbergpers.html&#34;&gt;Marcus Rossberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ole Thomassen Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/STAFF/wright.html&#34;&gt;Crispin Wright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt; and other people whose webpages I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on the next day in my talk in computer science, I had a great discussion with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~rd/&#34;&gt;Roy Dyckhoff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~rr/&#34;&gt;Robert Rothenberg&lt;/a&gt; on converting the sequent system in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;my paper on S5&lt;/a&gt; into one with invertible rules, which can then be used as an implementation.  It seems to work.  (Photographic evidence is &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/In%20Roy%20Dyckhoff&#39;s%20office,%20November%2016,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I went to three other talks on truth and paradox, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/hartryfield&#34;&gt;Hartry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/gp.html&#34;&gt;Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt;.  Now that I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly over-&lt;em&gt;paradoxed&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve got the morning to recover before we attempt to solve the problems of vagueness.  (This should be fun because I have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; settled opinion on matters of vagueness, so I&amp;rsquo;ll look at this more dispassionately, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be free to heckle from the back of the audience.)&lt;/p&gt;

This means I&amp;rsquo;ll miss the &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/VaguenessSeminar16Nov2005&#34;&gt;Vagueness Seminar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Dept/EventRegister&#34;&gt;Philosophy Departmental Colloquium&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I will be at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/ParadoxWorkshop&#34;&gt;Revenge Workshop&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/VaguenessWorkshop5&#34;&gt;Vagueness Workshop&lt;/a&gt; for Friday and Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be enough to keep me going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 1</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/10/11/week_1/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re now in the second day of &amp;ldquo;week 1&amp;rdquo; of Michaelmas, here in Oxford, and the philosophy faculty library is &lt;em&gt;considerably&lt;/em&gt; busier than it was in week 0, let alone the &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; weeks.  It&amp;rsquo;s just as well that I&amp;rsquo;ve got some writing done already.  Today I&amp;rsquo;m heading off to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; to give two talks.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy&#34;&gt;Philosophy Department&lt;/a&gt; will get the first outing of my fresh-off-the-presses paper &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;Invention is the Mother of Necessity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in which I try out a (new, I hope) semantically anti-realist account of metaphysical necessity and possibility.  Have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think, if you&amp;rsquo;re into that sort of thing.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting it also in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/Philosophy/index.html&#34;&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/&#34;&gt;St. Andrews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sann1762/Jowett.html&#34;&gt;here in Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, so it will probably see signifiant modifications and updates over the next months.  The other talk is the formal partner of that one, on proof theory for S5.  I&amp;rsquo;m still writing the notes up for this (we&amp;rsquo;ll see how much I can get written on the train today), and I&amp;rsquo;ll upload that when I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, with these papers largely written, I can get back to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;!  I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cut elimination generalised</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/09/17/cut_elimination_generalised/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2005 12:04:13 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/09/17/cut_elimination_generalised/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This post is a change of scene for those of you that have come to expect &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2005/09/03/reflections_on_iona_part_1&#34;&gt;gentle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2005/09/05/reflections_on_iona_part_2&#34;&gt;meditations&lt;/a&gt; on matters personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to experiment with posting some of my work scribblings as an irregular record of thoughts I&amp;rsquo;m having while working on sabbatical.  It may well confirm the impression that you might have that I&amp;rsquo;m crazy, but hey, I have tenure, so I won&amp;rsquo;t worry about that too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of days I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about cut elimination arguments, and in particular, the general cut elimination argument that you can find in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/041521534X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; (look around &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com/print?id=8u-IU3xTHrcC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=cut+elimination&amp;sig=lgHAlb56O39iT6gIVkimS7P_j8g&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It struck me last night &amp;ndash; as I was trying to find the right mix of generality and clarity &amp;ndash; that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s original argument that &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; that formulas have just two distinct positions in a sequent (the traditional two positions are &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;consequent&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, or if you like, &lt;em&gt;premise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;conclusion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt;).  Every presentation of cut elimination that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of (even for single sided systems which don&amp;rsquo;t have an explicit left or right to a sequent) has two &amp;ldquo;positions&amp;rdquo; in which a formula can reside.  (In single sided systems this is represented by the dualising map on formulas).  The point is seen in the structure of the identity rule (an instance of the formula on each position, left and right, is what gives you an &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;) and the cut rule (take two sequents, one with the formula in &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt; position, the other with it in &lt;em&gt;consequent&lt;/em&gt; position &amp;ndash; the &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; rule tells you how to combine them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as I was saying, it struck me last night (at approximately 1:30am &amp;ndash; I indulge myself by working late when my spouse is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ps.au.dk/showpage.asp?lPageID=34&#34;&gt;out of town&lt;/a&gt;) that the form of the traditional cut-elimination argument &amp;ndash; when you look at it in the right way, at least &amp;ndash; in no way requires that there are just two positions in a sequent.  You could have &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; if you like.  Or maybe &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;.  Or soemthing else entirely.  All you need is for identity and cut to interact in the right kind of way (cuts composed with identities disappear), for the rules to commute with cuts in parametric positions, and for cuts on principal formulas to be eliminable.  It works quite generally, which is very pretty.  (I have an example scrawled on pages of my notebook as I was taking a coffee after lunch this afternoon of a cut elimination theorem for a sequent system in which sequents have &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; different slots.  You can visualise proofs in this system as having input and output going from top to bottom on the page &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; different inputs and outputs going left-to-right.  In this picture, there are two kinds of cut: &lt;em&gt;horizontal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vertical&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the question for you, gentle reader (if you have read this far, as you seem to have): Can you think of any reason why we would &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; such a thing, beyond the insane desire to generalise well-known theorems and constructions?  Can you think of any applications in which you might want proof-like-objects to go in &amp;ldquo;more than one direction&amp;rdquo; in this sense, or analogously, in which you might have attitudes of more than just assertion and denial to propositional content and more importantly, have vocabulary that is sensitive to these different features?  I can think of &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bilattice&#34;&gt;one possibility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the second part of my reflections on our week on Iona.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that kind of news, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; significant thing about our time on Iona &amp;ndash; the week was tempered by an event just before we left for the island.  The story started on the Friday before we left Edinburgh on Saturday.  It was my last day teaching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;ESSLLI&lt;/a&gt;, and I was having lunch with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/_insti/r04/fr/content0501.php&#34;&gt;Denis Bonnay&lt;/a&gt; and Benjamin Simmenauer, talking about logic, and the possibility of me visting Paris &amp;ndash; just before giving the last lecture of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/giveabs.php?40&#34;&gt;my course&lt;/a&gt;.  My phone rings.  Inside the restaurant there is terrible reception, but I can see that it&amp;rsquo;s Christine calling.  I apologise to Denis and Ben, and head out of the restaurant to hear Christine.  She&amp;rsquo;s upset.  She says &amp;ldquo;Zachary&amp;rsquo;s had an accident.  We&amp;rsquo;re in the hospital.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine sounds like I feel &amp;ndash; frantic and unsettled.  She explains that Zachary fell while running down a hill in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scotland-flavour.co.uk/princes-street-gardens.html&#34;&gt;Princes Street Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in the centre of Edinburgh.  He split open his chin, there was a lot of blood, and after help from passers-by and a first aid officer from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natgalscot.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;Scottish National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, they were in an ambulance to the children&amp;rsquo;s hospital.  It was not clear whether or not he&amp;rsquo;d need stitches, but there was a large and deep cut, lots of blood &amp;ndash; Christine said it looked like he had a second mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next call from the hospital came with news that Zachary was calm (when he saw the toys), Christine was happier, and the doctor decided that he didn&amp;rsquo;t need stitches.  &amp;ldquo;Steri-strips&amp;rdquo; patched his chin together, and the bleeding stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I taught my last class, in a rather distracted manner, keen to get home.  I caught the bus into Haymarket and the train home to see my son with a smile on his face and rather more bandages than he had ever worn before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant that all of our time on Iona was punctuated with parental cries of &amp;ldquo;watch out for your chin!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t run so fast, if you trip you&amp;rsquo;ll hurt your chin!&amp;rdquo; and other admonishments, and we kept worrying about whether or not we&amp;rsquo;d be able to keep him &lt;em&gt;clean&lt;/em&gt; enough to avoid any infection in the cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long and the short of it was that he has healed up pretty well.  He did end up with a very mild infection but a quick check with the doctor on Thursday helped us change the strips to new ones, keep the wound much more ventilated, and since then it&amp;rsquo;s healed up nicely into a single line across his chin, fading daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other significant events on Iona included our group art project, for the Thursday night communion service and Friday morning leaving service, and our conceptual art &amp;ldquo;installations&amp;rdquo; on Thursday afternoon.  I&amp;rsquo;ll try to give you just a hint of what both activities involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stephenraw.com/&#34;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; explained that we were going to make a large banner of words, and that we would each paint a single &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt;.  We were given a colour pallette (green, red, brown, black, yellow), inspired by Africa, and we were choose a letter from a big list.  With some inspiration from lots of different examples of different fonts, we went off with a large rectangle of card, and ideas in our heads.  We didn&amp;rsquo;t know where our letter would feature in the banner, but we knew that it would be &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.  I chose one of the five *R*s, and Christine chose one of the four *C*s.  After much conversation and experimentation with technique, we finished our letters.  Steve and others then shuffled them around and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Assembling%20the%20banner,%20August%2025,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;assembled them&lt;/a&gt; into a nine by six banner of fifty-four different paintings to make one large artwork.  It scrubs up pretty well.  Christine&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; is great, with a wonderful watercolour effect in the background. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly fond of my &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; but I am happy with the experience of painting it (it&amp;rsquo;s been &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; since I did so much with a brush and paint that wasn&amp;rsquo;t applied monochromatically to a wall or a ceiling).  I was most happy with the effect once it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/The%20completed%20Banner,%20August%2025,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;hung in the Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.  You have a different relationship to an artwork when you have contributed one small recognisable part to the whole, which I suppose, was one of the ideas behind doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday&amp;rsquo;s artistic activity started at an odd place.  This time Christine didn&amp;rsquo;t take part because she went to the doctor with Zachary &amp;ndash; the doctor has a practice on Mull and she comes over to Iona once a week, on Thursday, for non-urgent consultations.  We were concerned because Zachary&amp;rsquo;s cut had bled the day before when we removed bandages.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, but we wanted a doctor&amp;rsquo;s opinion.  The opinon was what we thought.  It was mildly infected and not healing as quickly as it should be, the steri-strips should be re-applied and the wound should be exposed to the air to dry out and heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the art, Steve asked us to start with the following activity: we were to pair up and each person was choose a sheet from a pile, at random.  The sheet had the face of a person.  No name, no detail, just a &lt;em&gt;face&lt;/em&gt;. In our pairs, we were to imagine a conversation between the two people.  Not a mundane conversation, but one in which one of the people expressed some kind of need. I was paired with Margaret, Steve&amp;rsquo;s spouse.  We had a young white harried male executive (at least, he had a furrowed brow, was in an office, was well dressed and groomed, and was on the telephone), and an older, European woman, heavily made up, not so well off, and looking wistfully into the middle distance.  We decided that they were mother and son, estranged after years of slowly going apart.  They hadn&amp;rsquo;t been in touch for a couple of years.  He&amp;rsquo;s embarrassed by her ways, and she&amp;rsquo;s missing him and doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand his world.  She calls, to tell him she has been diagonsed with a grave illness and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have long to live.  He does not know how to react, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to see her, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that she wants him merely to &lt;em&gt;be with&lt;/em&gt; her rather than to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things.  While working through the conversation with Margaret, I&amp;rsquo;m affected me deeply because (as most of you know) my mother died nearly ten years ago, and Christine&amp;rsquo;s mum died five years ago. Roleplaying an imagined and imaginary conversation does not provoke imaginary emotions &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the art.  We act out the conversation in front of the group if we&amp;rsquo;re happy to do that &amp;ndash; Margaret and I were first to do it, and nearly everyone else was happy to do it too).  They were all equally touching and suprisingly varied and subtle. (The most fun was the two blokes doing the two elderly women, one &amp;lsquo;Anglo&amp;rsquo; and the other from the subcontinent.  That was unexpectedly touching and sweet.  They met at a doctors surgery and it was a meditation on what it was to have a home and a family.) While we acted out our conversation, the rest of the group were to note down significant &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; that they heard.  After it was all done, we looked at the words/phrases people noticed in the conversations and chose one that seemed to have some personal significance, and made it a part of an artwork.  Here, artwork was defined &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; broadly.  One of our number chose the phrase &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; and created a path up a hill near the centre with a length of wool, pausing halfway to spell &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; in wool and then leading on to the other side of the hill to stop.  At different stages through the day, different people followed the path and engaged with the artwork.  I chose the word &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; (the harried young man seemingly didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of it; the passing of time had seen the estrangement of mother and son; and I have a new relationship with time on this sabbatical) and knew almost immediately a part of what I wanted to do.  I wanted to deface all of the clocks in the centre, by cutting a strip of paper, emblazoned with the word &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;, over the face of the clock, not entirely obscuring the face, but confronting people with the word while they checked the clocks in their routine throughout the day.  This was a good start, but I wanted to do more.  In a community of over 50, you would think there would be many clocks but there were only three.  Christine suggested I get to work on watches.  So, I offered to replace everyone&amp;rsquo;s watch with a wristband (alas, I know, everyone is doing it these days &amp;ndash; my excuse is that this is a watch-substitute, not a sign of your allegience to an idea or a cause!) containing only the word &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;.  You could keep your watch but you mustn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;wear&lt;/em&gt; it for the rest of the day.  This was most enjoyable, appropriating people&amp;rsquo;s bodies for the artistic exercise.  (I know something of what advertisers must feel when they see people wearing their slogan on a T-shirt.)  It also gave me an opportunity to think in a different way about the passing of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday evening saw the communion service in the evening, and I was a part of a choir for that service, as I&amp;rsquo;d been a part of a &amp;ldquo;Wee Sing&amp;rdquo; earlier in the week, and I was a bass and we needed bass voices.  I also knew that this evening would see the first performance of a new song by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/?a=253&amp;amp;pr=78&#34;&gt;John Bell&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to Tim Williams, the music director at Iona for the year.  Tim is a young man, taking a year off from his Ph.D. in music at Cambridge to direct the music (and to teach untaught singers to sound halfway decent in a group).   John&amp;rsquo;s new song (a Sanctus/Benedictus) is wonderful &amp;ndash; not too difficult to sing in four parts, with a memorable melody and interesting harmonic movement, and it was a buzz to be a part of its first outing in a group.  (The song was written on the Monday, and we were rehearsing on Wednesday to sing on Thursday.)  The &amp;ldquo;wall of sound&amp;rdquo; effect that a choir of 40 or so can achieve in the small Abbey is something to be heard to be believed. I would&amp;rsquo;ve kept the music were it not for the note indicating that the sheets were to be destroyed after the performance. To hear what it sounds like, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to either come to Iona sometime or wait for the next music publication from &lt;a href=&#34;http://ionabooks.com/&#34;&gt;Wild Goose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains with me from the week on Iona, already passing into memory as I&amp;rsquo;ve been here in Oxford for a over a week, settling in.  It&amp;rsquo;s a memory, but as we explored in various ways through the artwork and through living on the island with so much history, and participating in community traditions going back so many years, memories can be &lt;em&gt;expressed&lt;/em&gt;, they can be &lt;em&gt;articulated&lt;/em&gt; (to engage in some philosophical jargon for a minute). Words provide a powerful means of articulating memories, and when we use words in creative ways, we not only express static memories, we can also bring to light previously hidden or unnoticed features of what we have seen or heard or experienced.  Sometimes we need new forms, new words, or whole new &lt;em&gt;vocabularies&lt;/em&gt; to account for what is before us. I came to understand this in a new way in Iona, and that is something that will stay with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone with whom I shared that week, thankyou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflections on Iona, part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is an extended post reflecting on the week in Iona.  Read on if you want to find out what we did for a week on a small Hebridean island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; straightforward to get to Iona, when you start from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.9eastbay.co.uk/&#34;&gt;our B&amp;amp;B in North Queensferry&lt;/a&gt;.  Our day&amp;rsquo;s journey started early with a taxi ride to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Stations/stations/EdinburghWaverley/Default.aspx&#34;&gt;Edinburgh Waverley&lt;/a&gt;, and then a train to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visitscotland.com/library/glasgowqueenstreet&#34;&gt;Glasgow Queen Street&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused, as many people do, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Stations/stations/glasgowcentral/Default.aspx&#34;&gt;Glasgow Central&lt;/a&gt;, an altogether different train station in an altogether different place).  With our bags piled around us, we had a little while to collect supplies for the next train trip, and to play the game of &amp;ldquo;who else here is going to Iona.&amp;rdquo;  The late-middle-aged single American women with loud voices and Celtic crosses were very easy to spot.  As was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/?a=253&amp;amp;pr=78&#34;&gt;John Bell&lt;/a&gt; (we&amp;rsquo;d met him on one of his visits to Australia).  We were less sure of others, but it turned out that lots of people on the train were heading to retreat on Iona, like us.  The rest of the trip was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/system/galleries/download/print_maps/uk.pdf&#34;&gt;long train journey west to Oban&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.calmac.co.uk/summer-mull-timetable2.html&#34;&gt;ferry from Oban to Craignure&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.calmac.co.uk/mull.html&#34;&gt;Mull&lt;/a&gt;, a bus across Mull to Fionnphort and then a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.calmac.co.uk/summer-iona-timetable.html&#34;&gt;ferry to Iona&lt;/a&gt;.  We got there in mid-afternoon, having left just after six in the morning.  That&amp;rsquo;s good going, considering the distance we travelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island itself is small and quiet, dark in the evenings (no streetlights) and filled with history.  It&amp;rsquo;s rugged, windswept, with noticeably variable weather, with skies as clear as a bell one day, and cloudy,  windy drizzly on the next.  (It was also a week of no internet connections, though I could have logged on to an internet terminal had I really wanted to.)  But the island is not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; far away from it all.  The outside world intrudes as are ferryloads of visitors disgorged onto the little island each day.  There are daytrippers, weeklong retreaters like us, and longer-term volunteers, workers on the community, and the residents.  Wherever you go, there the twenty-first century intrudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community sites on the island are the work of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iona.org.uk&#34;&gt;Iona Community&lt;/a&gt;, an ecumenical Christian community that runs two retreat centres on the island. The life in the community revolves around regular worship in the Abbey: 9am each day, afternoons and 9pm, and different &lt;a href=&#34;http://iona.org.uk/abbey/isp1.htm&#34;&gt;programs&lt;/a&gt; are run each week on different themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iona.org.uk/mac/main.htm&#34;&gt;MacLeod Centre&lt;/a&gt;, which caters for families. We were a part of a group of around fifty, parents, kids, singles, old and young.    Our week involved exploring the visual arts, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stephenraw.com/&#34;&gt;Stephen Raw&lt;/a&gt;, who lead us in workshops which managed to teach us some of the finer points of lettering, artistic expression, interpersonal skills of empathy and interpretation, memory, creativity, the relationship between individuals and a larger community, and many other things besides.  Our artworks were to make a nametag in pencil for a partner (Sunday) the painting of a single &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; (Monday), a painting of a single &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt; (Wednesday) to contribute to a large artwork for use in the service on Thursday night and Friday morning, and an artistic &amp;ldquo;installation&amp;rdquo; (Thursday) concerning a word/concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word for Monday&amp;rsquo;s exercise was chosen on the basis of a conversation with a partner about what we had thought about coming to Iona.  We then had to paint the word, and when we went off on an excursion to the island of Staffa (and Fingal&amp;rsquo;s Cave), Stephen and other people staying at the centre had them put up in the dining room and other places around the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the process of painting the word &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo;. I chose some dark grey paper (with a slightly reflective surface) and dark blue, purple and black paints for the letters.  I wanted a grey wash over the word to complete the sleepy/restful effect.  We were painting with pretty strong acrylic paints, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious how to get the grey wash. I asked Judy, the craft worker at the centre, and she found some silver powder paint that looked like it had been unused for years.  I mixed it up in a very watery way, and it provided an interesting wash effect, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem quite what I wanted.  As we were talking about how to get just the right effect Stephen then came up with an idea &amp;ndash; why not take the painting (appoximately 1.5 metres square) on the boat trip to Staffa, and put it in the water there?  This would make the paint run, but it would make the wash run much more than the words, which were painted in acrylic.  The &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; would also be something to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we rolled up the painting (once it was dryish) and off on the boat we went.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.holidaymull.org/attractions/staffa.htm&#34;&gt;Staffa and Fingal&amp;rsquo;s cave&lt;/a&gt; were stunning (the island is a part of the same rock formation as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geographia.com/northern-ireland/ukiant01.htm&#34;&gt;Giant&amp;rsquo;s Causeway&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland, with distinctive hexagonal rock formations), and after walking through the cave (in which the sound of the sea is the most ringing memory), with canvas in hand I traipsed down to water&amp;rsquo;s edge (at a point where the drop was not too precipitous, and where I could see the Abbey on Iona on the horizon), unrolled the paper and let the sea have its way with it.  The &amp;ldquo;baptism&amp;rdquo; completed, we spread it out to dry off some of the water but we eventually had to go to explore some of the rest of the island.  So, we folded up the painting, and let it stew in a plastic bag while we climbed to the top of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when we got back (with a tired Zachary, and a slightly seasick Christine, as the boat&amp;rsquo;s return to Iona was on a rising swell) we unfolded it and saw the effect.  It was great!  The silvery grey had run and the water had left a distinctive feathery pattern, and I had a painting that not only expressed a thought but bears marks not only from its maker but also the place in which it was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to say about Iona, but it&amp;rsquo;s already too late this afternoon. I&amp;rsquo;m off to do some grocery shopping and to cook dinner.  I&amp;rsquo;ll write more and post about the rest of the week when I&amp;rsquo;m on the net later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Phew!  We&amp;rsquo;re back in Oxford, and arrived in our house today.  We&amp;rsquo;re in a cute little 2 bedroom house in the northern outskirts of Oxford, a quick busride down Banbury Road into Wolfson or the centre of town.  I&amp;rsquo;m currently dealing with some of the backlog of email in a Starbucks (of all places!) with a wireless network.  The week at Iona was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ll write an extended post about it in a little while.  For now I have lots of other things to do to make the cute little house a bit more like a &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;, and figuring out how to best use my worktime for the best mix of reading, writing, going to seminars, giving talks, etc., etc.  (That and figuring out how I&amp;rsquo;ll live without internet access at home.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Too many things are happening for me to spend &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time posting here until the whirl of activity settles down.  Still, people have been wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on, so here&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a run-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Logic Colloquium, I went back to Denmark to rejoin the family, to have a holiday in Blokhus with close friends.  Much fun was had, involving sand dunes, beaches, rain, driving on the other side of the road, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Blokhus we trained to Copenhagen, where we all had more holiday, involving Tivoli (in the rain), Danish icecream, cathedrals, public transport, and a flash &lt;a href=&#34;http://danhostel.dk/vandrerhjem.asp?lan=uk&amp;amp;id=144&#34;&gt;designer hostel&lt;/a&gt;.  (Photographic evidence of some of this can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Copenhagen we flew to Heathrow (let me tell you, flying in to Heathrow from merely one timezone away is &lt;em&gt;qualitatively&lt;/em&gt; different from flying in from the antipodes) to catch a bus to Oxford, to spy out the land.  Unfortunately, spying out the land involved learning that our college had failed to find us accommodation for our stay, and that we were flung onto the open rental market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, a train to Edinburgh, where we&amp;rsquo;re staying in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.9eastbay.co.uk/&#34;&gt;B&amp;amp;B in North Queensferry&lt;/a&gt; with a wonderful host (thanks, Molly!) and a view over the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days involve train trips into Edinburgh (or Glasgow), enjoying the vibe of festival crowds, going to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; on Monday night, and me teaching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/&#34;&gt;ESSLLI&lt;/a&gt;.  That&amp;rsquo;s been fun, but my mind has been elsewhere much of the time attempting to arrange accommodation for Oxford by the internet and by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully (and with much help from our Oxford friends, Steven and Emma) we have secured a little two-bedroom house up Banbury Road from our college.  So now we can enjoy the rest of our time in Edinburgh a little more, and we can &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; rest up and enjoy our retreat in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iona.org.uk&#34;&gt;Iona&lt;/a&gt; next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today is Day 4 of the colloquium.  Yesterday was a day of rest, which for me involved a visit to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.culture.gr/2/21/214/21404m/e21404m1.html&#34;&gt;Byzantine and Christian Museum&lt;/a&gt;, in the morning, a lazy afternoon restructuring the order things in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/giveabs.php?40&#34;&gt;ESSLLI course&lt;/a&gt; while staying in the shade, and visiting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.herakleidon-art.gr/index.cfm?get=home&#34;&gt;Herakleidon Museum&lt;/a&gt; which featured an exhibit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.herakleidon-art.gr/index.cfm?get=exhibits&amp;amp;show=current&amp;amp;ItemID=31&#34;&gt;Escher prints&lt;/a&gt; (the detail in some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.herakleidon-art.gr/detail.cfm?ItemID=31&amp;amp;PhotoID=116&amp;amp;get=exhibits&amp;amp;StartRow=25&#34;&gt;woodcuts&lt;/a&gt; was beyond belief), and then the obligatory visit to the Acroplolis as it got slightly cooler.  Photographic evidence is found &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam&#34;&gt;over there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today features lots of philosophical logic and proof theory.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post comments as we go, battery life and concentration permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First up&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Sheard, on &amp;ldquo;A transactional approach to the logic of truth&amp;rdquo;.  The topic was theories of truth, involving consistent reductions of the class of &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; biconditionals &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; iff &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. The liar paradox causes problems, so Michael gave a nice overview of the kinds of consistent thoeries of truth that weaken the assumptions to restore consistency.  He argued for what he called a &amp;ldquo;transactional approach,&amp;rdquo; to thinking about the issue which &amp;ndash; sensibly, in my view &amp;ndash; focusses on why one might be interested in using the concept of truth, in communication between agents, and in evaluation of what those agents say. One nice thing  in the talk was that he gave a very nice overview of the kinds of problems afflicting different truth theories (such as &amp;omega;-inconsistency or non-conservativeness over the basic theory).  As I actually &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/minitrue/&#34;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; some of the theories which are prone to these phenomena, I need to think about this some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/&#34;&gt;Helmut Schwichtenberg&lt;/a&gt;.  He gave an overview of his work on minimal logic for representing computational content.  The idea is a straightforward one: it&amp;rsquo;s been long known that &amp;lambda; terms do a good job of encoding proofs in minimal implicational logic.  Other terms can be use to encode proof structure of conjunction, disjunction, quantifiers, etc.  Helmut has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://minlog-system.de/&#34;&gt;working on&lt;/a&gt; a system in which natural deduction in minimal logic can be used to represent proofs, and terms in the system encode proofs in a handy fashion, and these proofs encode &lt;em&gt;programs&lt;/em&gt;.  (The fact that classical proofs can be embedded in proofs in minimal logic means that even classical proofs can construct programs too.)  That much I was familiar with.  The new and interesting material for me was Helmut&amp;rsquo;s technique for associating each formula &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; with a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; &amp;tau;(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;), representing the &lt;em&gt;computational content&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  The idea is that atomic mathematical statements (identities between ground terms, for example) have no computational content, but that other logical constructions, such as existential or universal quantification &lt;em&gt;introduce&lt;/em&gt; computational content.  The idea then is that we keep track of computational content as we prove something, and the computational content gives us a handle on the upshot for computation of each statement.  I did not get all of the details, but a simple google search dug up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~minlog/minlog/mlcf.ps&#34;&gt;this very recent account of the technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~petera/&#34;&gt;Peter Aczel&lt;/a&gt;, on Constructive Set Theory.  This was the first of two introductory talks on constuctive set theory, and in particular the system CZF, of constructive ZF set theory, which differs from the other system of intuitionistic set theory IZF by avoiding impredicativity by having weak versions of the separation axiom, and in which the powerset axiom is avoided completely in favour of conditions which generate sets of &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding the powerset axiom important in non-classical set theories, because there are &lt;em&gt;very many&lt;/em&gt; subsets of very simple sets.  In particular, the singleton set 1 = {0} has very many subsets: it has one for each &lt;em&gt;truth value&lt;/em&gt;, so much so that the power &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; of the singleton, {x | x is a subset of 1}, which we can call &amp;Omega; may well be very &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;.  You can see this, because it is straightforward to prove, for any statement &amp;phi; that there is a set {x : x = 0 and &amp;phi;}, and then, this set is a subset of 1, and it contains 0 &lt;em&gt;to the degree to which &amp;phi; is true&lt;/em&gt;.  This is very cute, and it makes set theory on anything other than two-valued logic quite different and quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to work with sets of functions, rather than sets of subsets, because the set of functions from a set &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; to the two-element set {0,1} is much more manageable than the power class &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter also gave a nice sketch of the many different kinds of constructive mathematics there are, and showed how his own work in constructive set theory fits in.  His aim is to provide a set-theoretical vocabulary which is both motivated on the basis of a Martin-L&amp;ouml;f type theory, and extensional (hence the talk of &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt;) and applicable to the bulk of contemporary mathematics on the other.  It&amp;rsquo;s a laudable goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pity that I won&amp;rsquo;t hear tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s class when Peter covers inductive and coinductive definitions (I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to hear that) and constructive topology.  I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ml.kva.se/preprints/meta/AczelMon_Sep_24_09_16_56.rdf.html&#34;&gt;this set of notes&lt;/a&gt; from 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; two talks I managed to get to were by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/~negri/&#34;&gt;Sara Negri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbg.ac.at/phs/people/leitgeb_e.html&#34;&gt;Hannes Leitgeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, they were a great way to end the conference.  In the special session on Philosophical Logic orgnaised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://kleene.ss.uci.edu/~aldo/&#34;&gt;Aldo Antonelli&lt;/a&gt;, they were interesting new developments on topics I&amp;rsquo;m actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;em&gt;Sara&lt;/em&gt;.  She presented a uniform way to add to G3c &amp;ndash; the nice sequent calculus for classical logic in which the structural rules for contraction and weakening are not explicit but are admissible &amp;ndash; labels and an explicit accessibility relation, in order to treat a whole host of normal modal logics, and for good measure, intermediate and substructural logics as well.  The different systems are given by different rules governing the accessibility relation, and the system has nice proof theoretical properties no matter what accessibility conditions you have. In other words, it has exactly the right kind of separation between connective rules on the one hand and generalised &amp;lsquo;structural&amp;rsquo; rules on the other. (If we admit the simple rules between statements of accessibility relation under the &amp;lsquo;structural&amp;rsquo; heading for a moment &amp;ndash; I have a reason for doing this, as you might see later.) The trickiest bit of the paper was the treatment of &lt;em&gt;provability&lt;/em&gt; logics, which have been hard to treat in proof calculi.  Sara manages to get sequent systems for &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; logics too, by changing the rules for necessity.  I&amp;rsquo;ll have to read the paper in detail to see how this works out.  Thankfully, the paper will be out in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Philosohpical Logic&lt;/em&gt; quite soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best for me is that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that I have a direct translation between the labelled sequent formulation that Sara uses and the non-labelled structural formulation of a calculus that I&amp;rsquo;m working on via proofnets.  It &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; very  natural when you see how it works.  I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out the details, but once I have something concrete, I&amp;rsquo;ll write it up and explain the translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;em&gt;Hannes&lt;/em&gt;.  His paper continued the theme of formal theories of truth started by Mike Sheard in his morning talk.  Hannes took &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt; and showed what you need to do to treat it as a predicate of sentences, in the same way that we treat truth.  Taking work from his very recent &lt;em&gt;JPL&lt;/em&gt; paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;amp;id=doi:10.1007/s10992-004-3758-3&#34;&gt;What Truth Depends On&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; he showed how to extend the consistent treatment of truth to one of necessity (or other normal modal operators).  This is not straightforward, since a well-known result due to Montague shows that liar-like paradoxes follow from the weak principles of necessity elimination (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;phi; &amp;rarr; &amp;phi;) and necessitation (if &amp;phi; is a provable, then so is &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;phi;), given that you can form fixed point sentences like the liar.  (That&amp;rsquo;s the down-side between treating necessity as a predicate rather than an operator.  The upside is that you get such expressive power: by being able to treat necessity as a predicate you can quantify into the sentential place, and do lots of nice things.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Hannes explained what you should do to recover some decent modal logic in the context in which necessity is treated as a predicate and not an operator.  The trick is to see that you do need to restrict the application of the offending rules (necessity elimination and necessitation) to a class of formulas.  In this case, Hannes has a nice explanation of what it is to be self-referential, and what it is to be ungrounded (and these clearly differ &amp;ndash; there can be ungrounded sentences that aren&amp;rsquo;t self referential &amp;ndash; this is discussed in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;amp;id=doi:10.1007/s10992-004-3758-3&#34;&gt;What Truth Depends On&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;).  Then, a nice preservation construction is used to show that you can model the operation of necessity on the &lt;em&gt;grounded&lt;/em&gt; sentences in such a way as to get any normal modal logic you want, restricted to grounded sentences. The construction is very nice, and Hannes gives an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; clear talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage of the proceedings, my brain had completely melted, so I went out and had a drink with &lt;a href=&#34;http://kleene.ss.uci.edu/~aldo/&#34;&gt;Aldo&lt;/a&gt;, and then we had dinner once the rest of the crew (including Hannes, Sara, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/%7Evonplato/&#34;&gt;Jan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.unibo.it/~corsi/&#34;&gt;Giovanna&lt;/a&gt;) finished the late session.  I managed to reduce my &lt;em&gt;Trotsky number&lt;/em&gt; (the length of the chain of the form &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; shook hands with &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; shook hands with &amp;hellip; shook hands with &lt;em&gt;Trotsky&lt;/em&gt;) down to three &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_van_Heijenoort&#34;&gt;Giovanna&lt;/a&gt;, who once shared an office with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_van_Heijenoort&#34;&gt;Jean van Heijenoort&lt;/a&gt;, so now my Trotsky number is lower than my Erd&amp;ouml;s number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for my conference blogging.  The conference continues for Day 5, but I&amp;rsquo;m flying off to rejoin family.  I&amp;rsquo;m passing the baton to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; who has promised to blog some of Day 5&amp;rsquo;s proceedings.  Posts here will resume their usual infrequency, and I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy some break before the onslaught in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logic Colloquium 2005 Day 3</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s another busy day with lots of things to learn.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my impressions so far, updated through the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:20&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/kolaitis/&#34;&gt;Phokion Kolaitis&lt;/a&gt; is giving his second lecture &amp;mdash; he&amp;rsquo;s good, and it&amp;rsquo;s been interesting to learn about &lt;em&gt;dichotomy&lt;/em&gt; theorems in CSPs.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.info.unicaen.fr/~zanutti/rechch/identif.htm&#34;&gt;Schaefer&amp;rsquo;s dichotomy results&lt;/a&gt; cast in terms of constraint satisfaction problems, are really interesting.  The idea is that we can think of a class of constraints as expressed as the problem of whether or not there&amp;rsquo;s a homomorphism betwen your structure and another one (which is thought of as expressing the constraints).  So, 3-colourability might be expressed as the existence or nonexistence of a homomorphism between your graph and the complete graph K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  If there is such a homomorphism, your graph is 3-colourable, if there isn&amp;rsquo;t, your graph &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.   Phokion&amp;rsquo;s talk yesterday explained why CSPs can be expressed as homomorphism existence fact.  The idea is that conjunctive queries (predicate logic expressions using existential quantification and conjunction only) have exactly the right kind of preservation properties to express these homomorphism existence facts on relational structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Schaefer&amp;rsquo;s result is that the problem of whether or not (for a given boolean algebra &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;), the issue of whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ve got a homomorphism from your structure into &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, is either solvable in polynomial time (like 2-colourability) or is NP-complete (like 3-colourability &amp;ndash; K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t a boolean algebra, but 3-colourability apparently can be expressed as CSP(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) for some boolean algebra).  This is nice.  Even if P isn&amp;rsquo;t NP, CSP(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is not in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phokion is now explaining Feder &amp;amp; Vardi&amp;rsquo;s conjecture that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; structure &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; has this dichotomy &amp;mdash; not only boolean algebras. There are some nice results approaching this.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/andrei.bulatov&#34;&gt;Andrei Bulatov&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/andrei.bulatov/FOCS02.ps&#34;&gt;showed that&lt;/a&gt; the conjecture works for structures of size up to &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;.  So, there&amp;rsquo;s only 4,5,6,&amp;hellip; to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1:30&lt;/em&gt;: Now some impressionistic comments on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/haskell/&#34;&gt;Deirdre Haskell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talk on &amp;lsquo;Independence types in algebraically closed valued fields&amp;rsquo;.  This was a model theory talk, and I&amp;rsquo;m not a mathematical model theorist, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow everything by any means.  Deirdre is exploring how independence results from the analysis of &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; theories cross over to &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; theories, and in particular, valued fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in the program started by &lt;a href=&#34;http://shelah.logic.at/&#34;&gt;Shelah&lt;/a&gt;: we&amp;rsquo;re interested in the number, I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) of models cardinality &amp;lambda; of a first-order theory &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.  What can I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) be?  Given an &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; theory (typically, that&amp;rsquo;s a theory with a linear ordering or something like it, such as a valuation function onto a linear ordering), I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) is 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is as big as it can be.  (Theories with orderings, such as the theory of rationals, are unstable, so are theories with orderings on a definable subset &amp;ndash; such as theories with &lt;em&gt;valuations&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, an anyone recommend the best introduction to stability in the model theoretic sense?  Should I just read Shelah&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://shelah.logic.at/short000.html&#34;&gt;initial paper on the topic&lt;/a&gt;?  I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to it now, so I can&amp;rsquo;t tell what it&amp;rsquo;s like.  Hodges&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modeltheory-fo/&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia entry&lt;/a&gt; is great, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t scratch my itch.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if the theory we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt;, then we don&amp;rsquo;t have as much information about this.  And hence, &lt;em&gt;stability&lt;/em&gt; theory.  (This talk was the clearest explanation of stability theory I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of hearing).  Stable theories are algebraically closed fields, differentiably closed fields, etc.   The notion of forking (or non-forking), in pure model theories is important for studying stable theories, and in this case &amp;ndash; in classification theory &amp;ndash; model theorists exclusively studied stable theories since the problem of finding I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) was solved for unstable &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.  But we&amp;rsquo;re interested in unstable &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; for other reasons.  Now people (like Deirdre Haskell) are using the tools from the study of stable theories in work on unstable theories.  She talked about the application of independence notions in the study of algebraically closed fields (they&amp;rsquo;re fields in which polynomials have solutions) with valuations.  A valuation is a map &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; from the field to some ordered group with an infinite element &amp;infin; added, where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;ab&lt;/em&gt;) = &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;+&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) = min(&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(a),&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(b))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(0) = &amp;infin;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; measures a kind of size (backwards!) and it gives the field a kind of stratification (and, for extra fun, a topology).  It also induces enough of an ordering on the field to make the theory unstable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, algebraically closed valued fields (AVCFs to their friends) are neat, because they are often (always? I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch how this worked in general) characterised by their maximal ideal (the elements &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; where &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;gt; 0) and their residue field (the quotient of the AVCF with the maximal ideal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is generated by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_series&#34;&gt;Formal Laurent series&lt;/a&gt; over a field F in some term &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;.  These are power series, each going from index -&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; to infinity (you go negative to get inverses), and you let the valuation measure of a series to be its choce for -&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;, the first degree for which its coefficient is non-zero.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be negative.  (So, only finitely many of the negative degree coefficients are zero, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have all of the positive coefficients non-zero.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In fact, this is just a valued field, not an algebraically closed one, as we don&amp;rsquo;t have roots of the term &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;.  To fix this it&amp;rsquo;s enough to consider power series in each term &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1/&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for any &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, so-called &lt;a href=&#34;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/FractionalPowerSeries.html&#34;&gt;Puiseux series&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The super-neat &lt;em&gt;aha&lt;/em&gt; moment for me was when Deirdre drew the power series as a path in a tree.  The idea is that you list the exponents one at a time, and at each index, you have a branch for each element of the coefficient field.  (Lovely!  A talk with pictures!  It&amp;rsquo;s a pity that I won&amp;rsquo;t draw one for you here if for some weird reason you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far.)  That insight (simple enough that it is) was worth the price of admission alone for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first-order theory of AVCFs can be axiomatised with a predicate for the relation &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;), and an axiom scheme for being algebraically closed.  Deirdre then explained the definable sets (which turn out to be boolean combinations of open and closed &lt;em&gt;balls&lt;/em&gt; in the underlying topology), and then she got to work defining different notions of independence in these critters.  It turned out to be quite pretty, because in this case, even though the structure wasn&amp;rsquo;t stable, it seemed to have &amp;lsquo;enough&amp;rsquo; stability to get nice notions out.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got to the limit of my understanding, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve heroically read this far, I&amp;rsquo;ll point you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/%7Ehaskell/revisedACVF1.pdf&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/%7Ehaskell/ACVF-independence.pdf&#34;&gt;preprints&lt;/a&gt; on this material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I notice that I&amp;rsquo;ve come out sounding a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; like a mathematician here, but I&amp;rsquo;m not one.  You might wonder why a philosophical logician like me gets excited by talks like this outside my field.  It&amp;rsquo;s simple.  I like understanding things, and proving things, and seeing new constructions and ways of representing things.  Being stretched out of my own zone of familiarity and experience really does help. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes conferences like this neat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later today, my second talk, and also a series of contributed papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much later&lt;/em&gt;: OK, I&amp;rsquo;ve survived giving my talk.  (I even finished with time for questions and discussion in the timeslot, without being too rushed at the end.)  Discussion with people afterwards was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had good, constructive, feedback from &lt;a href=&#34;http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/&#34;&gt;Melvin Fitting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/&#34;&gt;Helmut Schwichtenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/~negri/&#34;&gt;Sara Negri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~neil/&#34;&gt;Neil Leslie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.unibo.it/~corsi/&#34;&gt;Giovanna Corsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbg.ac.at/phs/people/leitgeb_e.html&#34;&gt;Hannes Leitgeb&lt;/a&gt;, and someone else whose name I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch but who asked a really perceptive question about the actual world in my proof circuits for S5.  (I must catch up with him to properly acknowledge him.)  Thanks, everyone!  There are obviously more people I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk to (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;, where did you get to?) but time today seemed to run out.  I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ve got to use Monday wisely, as I&amp;rsquo;m not at the conference on Tuesday &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve got to fly back out to rejoin my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I managed to get lots of ideas about how to improve the material, pointers to similar work done before, and possibilities for future investigation.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve got any thoughts about the material, feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;add them to the wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon&amp;rsquo;s contributed sessions, I got to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~til/staff/stouppa.html&#34;&gt;Phiniki Stouppa&lt;/a&gt; present her material on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linearity.org/cas/phiniki/phiniki04sbm.pdf&#34;&gt;Calculus of Structures for S5&lt;/a&gt;.  That was really nice to see: especially to see how she compared the CoS treatment of S5 with other treatments like Display Logic.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to explain in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;my talk&lt;/a&gt; how my circuits for S5 relates to display logic, but I obviously come down on the side of dispaly logic as making sense here, and I take the display calculus &amp;lsquo;connectives&amp;rsquo; to ways (complicated as they may be) to talk about these circuits.  The other (hyper-)sequent system for S5 that comes out of the circuits is in one sense a &amp;lsquo;reduction&amp;rsquo; of the display sequent calculus in which display equivalent sequents are identified.  (Anyway, I need to write all of that up before I say too much more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, two of the other contributed talks I wanted to go to were cancelled because the speakers didn&amp;rsquo;t show up.   Nonetheless, I got to hear a nice talk by Dimeter Vakarelov on modal correspondence theory (the topic of when it is that a modal formula &lt;em&gt;corresponds to&lt;/em&gt; a first order condition on a modal frame).  He has a nice technique of getting more than the usual Sahlqvist formulas (a syntactically characterised class of formulas) by means of an algorithm instead of a simple description of the syntax.  The idea is that the class of formulas is decided by an algorithm (turn the handle, do this, if it succeeds you have a first order correspondent, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t, well, you don&amp;rsquo;t).  This paper was a generalisation of some earlier work by Vakarelov and Conradie and Goranko &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aiml.net/volumes/volume5/Goranko.ps&#34;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;, in which the class of formulas is &lt;em&gt;even bigger&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s the state of the art in correspondence theory.  (A nice short overview of correspondence theory is in &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan/SL-stanford.pdf&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan&#34;&gt;Johan van Benthem&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; correspondence theory in the 1970s.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it from me.  Tomorrow is a break day (when I&amp;rsquo;ll explore some of the city), and I&amp;rsquo;ll resume posting conference information on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logic Colloquium 2005 Day 2</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/07/29/logic_colloquium_2005_day_2/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/07/29/logic_colloquium_2005_day_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:25&lt;/em&gt;: There&amp;rsquo;s wireless access in the large lecture theatre, so I&amp;rsquo;ll take notes and upload comments occassionally through the day.  At the moment, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/kolaitis/&#34;&gt;Phokion Kolaitis&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/phonecam/Phokion%20Kolaitis%20giving%20his%20CSP%20Course,%20Logic%20Colloquium,%20July%2029,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;giving his first short course lecture&lt;/a&gt; on constraint satisfaction problems.  So far he&amp;rsquo;s talking about examples of CSPs (graph colourings and 3-SAT are his first examples) and he&amp;rsquo;s just looking now at homomorphisms of relational structures, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://theory.stanford.edu/~tomas/&#34;&gt;Feder&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/&#34;&gt;Vardi&lt;/a&gt; claim (&lt;a href=&#34;http://theory.stanford.edu/~tomas/constraint.ps&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;) that CSPs may be idenified with (or may be represented by) the problem of whether or not there&amp;rsquo;s a homomorphism between two relational structures.  (This bit is new to me, so I&amp;rsquo;ll listen closely.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11:20&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmfd.nsu.ru/mmf/persons/gonch.htm&#34;&gt;Sergey Goncharov&lt;/a&gt; giving an invited lecture on &amp;lsquo;Isomorphisms and Definable Relations on Computable Models&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s always struck me as &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; that infinite ordinals have something to do with the characterisation of computable structures (where being computable is an essentially finitary notion in one sense &amp;ndash; any computation process can be finitely described), but then, ordinal notations are finite too.  Sergey&amp;rsquo;s talk is about constucting interesting structures (boolean algebras, rings etc.) that are computable, but have the Scott Rank of &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CK&lt;/sup&gt; (that&amp;rsquo;s big).  This generalises some earlier results of Makkai (who showed that there were arithmetical structures of that rank) and Knight and Sheard (who showed that there were &lt;em&gt;computable&lt;/em&gt; structures with that high a rank).  Goncharov&amp;rsquo;s results (proved by coding structures inside other structures) show how to construct familiar structures that are this complex.  A related recent preprint is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nd.edu/~wcalvert/preprints/moreo1ck.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;13:13&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.wisc.edu/~pezz/&#34;&gt;Itay Ben-Yaacov&lt;/a&gt; is on now, with the first of two classes on model theory in positive and continuous logics.  (His is the first presentation using &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;beamer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; the slides look very nice indeed.  I can&amp;rsquo;t find the slides online, but an introductory paper on the same topic was recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1101/1101-002.ps&#34;&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of Symbolic Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and so can be downloaded. (Thanks, &lt;em&gt;BSL&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itaj&amp;rsquo;s work is interesting, because seeing odd logics motivated by mathematical considerations.  In this case, he&amp;rsquo;s interested in &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; logics (he likes to do without Boolean negation).  The idea is that in certain known model constructions (adding so-called &amp;lsquo;imaginary&amp;rsquo; elements to a model), the entire first-order theory of the original model is true in the extension.  This &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; work with the addition of &amp;lsquo;hyperimaginaries&amp;rsquo;. (While imaginaries are  classes of tuples (modulo a definable equivalence relation on the original model &amp;ndash; think of imaginary numbers as equivalence classes of pairs of reals), hyperimaginaries are definable classes of &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; tuples.)  Looking at what is preserved in model extension with hyperimaginaries, it turns out that you want to avoid Boolean negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These seem to be much more finely controlled results than the kinds of preservation under completely &lt;em&gt;arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; extension discussed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://logicandlanguage.net&#34;&gt;Gill Russell&lt;/a&gt; and me &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/barriers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  There must be interesting results involved in classifying what kinds of statements are preserved in what kinds of expansions of models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:15&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; in 15 minutes.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much, much later&lt;/em&gt;: OK, the live-blogging has ceased with me giving my talk, talking to people afterwards, and then going to the contributed talks in the later afternoon in the rooms where there&amp;rsquo;s no WiFi.  Presumably the heavy day, early mornings, late nights and being drained after giving my talk partially explain why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly good at concentrating during the all-to-short contributed talks in the afternoon.  There were some nice highlights however.  I caught up with some interesting material on fixpoint quantifiers and bisimulation quantifiers in modal logics (in a talk by Giacomo Lenzi), and in Dumitru Busneag&amp;rsquo;s talk, I was introduced to some nice algebra: the notion of a &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; filter in a lattice ordered non-commutative doubly residuated algebra.  It&amp;rsquo;s a filter of which left implication is a member iff the corresponding right implication is a member.  Then for any normal filter &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; and an element &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is the set of all &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; where &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is defined similarly) just like with normal subgroups.  That&amp;rsquo;s kind-of nice.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if these filters will play quite as &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; of an important role in these algebras as normal subgroups pay in group theory, but it&amp;rsquo;s pleasing to see the parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I need sleep.  I won&amp;rsquo;t be &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as keen tomorrow in the long day sessions, as I plan to be conscious in more of the contributed sessions in the later afteroon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logic Colloquium 2005 Day 1</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/07/29/logic_colloquium_2005_day_1/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2005 07:23:56 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/07/29/logic_colloquium_2005_day_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try this conference blogging thing, to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uoa.gr/lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium&lt;/a&gt; has started, with the opening address by Charles Parsons from Harvard.  His talk was on Paul Bernay&amp;rsquo;s later philosophy of mathematics &amp;mdash; a subject of which I knew &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.  So I learned a bit.  After Bernays&amp;rsquo; collaboration with Hilbert at G&amp;ouml;ttingen, he left Germany because of Nazi persecution, and spent the rest of his working life in Switzerland.  His philosophy of mathematics (according to Parsons) post war is characterised by his response to G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s results and the failure of Hilbert&amp;rsquo;s program.  For Bernays, mathematical truth is not necessarily &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; in any strong sense &amp;ndash; mathematical claims are verified in the competition of different conflicting mathematical theories, in just the same way that scientific theories are verified in competition with other theories.  The category of the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; is relativised into the weaker catergory of the &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt;.  There are always beliefs or theories antecedent to our views, which may be examined, clarified and accepted and rejected.  But nothing makes those especially immune from criticism or revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a Quinean holism, but it&amp;rsquo;s not.  It is motivated by a kind of neo Kantianism, and Bernays shares none of Quine&amp;rsquo;s empiricism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of Parsons&amp;rsquo; points was that Bernays had a distinctive kind of platonist structuralism, akin in one sense to Carnap&amp;rsquo;s view of mathematical truth. He had a similar distinction between internal and external questions &amp;ndash; the theory itself tells us that there &lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt; a prime between 15 and 19, at it tells us that 17 is prime &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s all there is to exsitence, from the point of view of inside the theory.  It makes no sense to ask that quesiton &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made Bernays&amp;rsquo; platonism distinctive, according to Parsons, was that he thought that you could have &lt;em&gt;degrees&lt;/em&gt; of platonic existence for mathematical objects.  There was more or less objective existence depending on different criteria.  This reminds me of the Crispin Wright material on the degree to which a discourse might be apt for objective truth (cognitive command, wide cosmological role etc.), so I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s any connection there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Parsons pointed to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/bernays/&#34;&gt;Bernays Project&lt;/a&gt; to translate his works into English.  A lot of the material is available online, so you can have at it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk there was a concert, and a reception.  At the latter I was able to catch up with people that I&amp;rsquo;ve corresponded with, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.let.uu.nl/~ctl/docenten/visser.html&#34;&gt;Albert Visser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard Zach&lt;/a&gt;.  Such nice people being around means that this should be a fun conference. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time for some sleep before tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s activity.  I need to be awake for &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;at least one class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legroom</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Remind me to check legroom on airlines before I book them for the first time &amp;ndash; especially if I&amp;rsquo;m planning to write on the plane.  Maersk Airlines has an interesting policy of offering seats in S/M/L sizes.  S seats have a tight pitch of 29 inches (73-and-a-bit centimetres).  You can upgrade to a roomier seet for a price&amp;ndash;a fact that the stewards make clear repeatedly on the flight itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleased that I got a seat in an otherwise empty row of three in an otherwise packed cabin. Another person asked to move into one of them, and between us, we had the middle seat to stretch our legs just a little and open my laptop.  (This is also the one occasion in which a 12inch Powerbook has a distinct advantage over my 17inch model.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Athens tomorrow.  Tonight I catch the train to K&amp;oslash;benhavn, where I stay overnight in a cheap hotel near the airport, to get my 7:30am flight. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uoa.gr/lc2005&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt; looks like it will be lots of fun.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy writing slides, and I should use the time on the train to put the finishing touches on Day 2. Once they&amp;rsquo;re done, I&amp;rsquo;ll post them on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re coming to Athens, feel free to post things up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;that wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a map using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plazes.com&#34;&gt;plazes&lt;/a&gt;, a neat little doodad that keeps track of where you are when you use a computer to access the net (if you explicitly log in yourself&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s not spying on you without your consent).  It powers the map on the main page here, and you can use it to generate a map of where you&amp;rsquo;ve been.  Read on if you want to see our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re settled in &amp;Aring;rhus now, while Christine does work with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ps.au.dk/showpage.asp?lNobuffer=1&amp;amp;lPageID=86&#34;&gt;colleague&lt;/a&gt; on a research project.  This gives Z and me lots of time for lots of fun.  Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s fun was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/&#34;&gt;Legoland&lt;/a&gt; (Vibeke and Christine wanted to come too, so we all made a day of it).  Z loved the rides, and the displays, and the Lego for sale.  We bought a &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.lego.com/RetiredProducts.asp?p=4402&#34;&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; for him to grow into.  There&amp;rsquo;s lots of fiddly pieces, but we&amp;rsquo;ve already managed to make &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Zachary%20and%20a%20Lego%20creation,%20July%2019,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;one of the models&lt;/a&gt; together. (He does the putting together and I help find the pieces for him.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to cook some dinner now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We fly later today!  The big study leave adventure starts later this afternoon.  The first few weeks alternate holidays and work for Christine and for me, and it gives us lots of time to enjoy the company of our young son.  Zachary and I are especially looking forward to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/&#34;&gt;Legoland in Billund&lt;/a&gt; and exploring the surrounds of &amp;Aring;rhus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our apartment apparently has an internet connection (I have no idea what kind, as of yet) so I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully be able to post photos and comments here to keep you up to date from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sometimes music is best heard &lt;em&gt;at volume&lt;/em&gt;.  A case in point?  The second movement of Shostakovich&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;String Quartet No. 8&lt;/em&gt;.  I recommend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000042HV/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Fitzwilliam String Quartet recording&lt;/a&gt;.  (The Emerson Quartet&amp;rsquo;s recording is &lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=7300788&amp;amp;selectedItemId=7300697&#34;&gt;available on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, but the Fitzwilliams&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Apologies to our next door neighbours.  I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying my last bout of loud music at home before we travel and don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/05/08/nad_c521bee/&#34;&gt;decent sound system&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;Australasian Journal of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is firing on all cylinders again.  As the managing editor, there was a period in this last semester where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t managing very well, and things piled up and got the better of me for quite some time. To speak overly frankly for a moment, I got &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; depressed over the state that things were in and over my own disorganisation. Unfortunately, being depressed is not a good condition in which to be motivated to do anything about that which you&amp;rsquo;re depressed about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a few solid days of working at it, sending things off, writing reports, collating information, copy-editing, typesetting, emailing, coding HTML, uploading, etc., I have something to show for it.  And I&amp;rsquo;m feeling much better about it all, too.  So, without further ado: Here&amp;rsquo;s the start of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/2005&#34;&gt;Volume 3: 2005&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of it.  Thanks to the authors, and to my referees and readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently eighteen other papers in various stages of the submission pipeline, so you should expect us to be much more productive over the last half of 2005, when compared to the first.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On applescript and php, and an archive page</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/06/26/on_applescript_and_php_and_an_archive_page/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2005 20:24:30 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/06/26/on_applescript_and_php_and_an_archive_page/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A half hour of php hacking has finally produced a working &lt;a href=&#34;phonecam&#34;&gt;archive page&lt;/a&gt; for the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting from my phonecam.  My little Sony Ericsson T630 phone has a terribly lo-res camera, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to take shots now and then when you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally take photos.  Now, instead of sliding off the front page when I upload another one, you can see the old photos &lt;a href=&#34;phonecam&#34;&gt;on the archive page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes the thing fun is that the process of uploading them is so easy.  The camera has a bluetooth connection to the computer, so I can get photos from the camera while the camera is still in my pocket.  (That&amp;rsquo;s easy.)  Then I drag a photo to an icon on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/pro/training/macosx_basics/segment102663b.html&#34;&gt;dock on my computer&lt;/a&gt; and the little applescript I wrote pops up a dialogue box to enter a title, and the thing scales the image (the camera takes pictures at 288x352 and I scale them to 180x220 to fit in the sidebar) and uploads the result to the &lt;a href=&#34;phonecam&#34;&gt;/phonecam directory&lt;/a&gt; on consequently.org.  The next bit of magic is two php scripts.  One on the main page takes the latest jpg file out of the /phonecam directory and puts it in the right sidebar.  (The title is the filename with &amp;ldquo;.jpg&amp;rdquo; stripped out.)  The other is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/phonecam&#34;&gt;phonecam&lt;/a&gt; page, which uses more php to read the entries in last-to-first order, insert month headers for every new month, and put them on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if anything looks weird from your end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/06/24/logic_colloquium_2005_and_esslli_2005/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m teaching some classes on proof theory at &lt;a href=&#34;http://eudoxos.math.uoa.gr/~lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;ESSLLI 2005&lt;/a&gt; soon.  Spurred on a little bit by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.antimeta.org/blog/archives/2005/05/few.html&#34;&gt;discussion of commentary at conferences&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered a little bit about how I can get interesting feedback going during/after the presentations.  (The material I&amp;rsquo;ll be teaching is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;em&gt;Work very-much-in Progress&lt;/em&gt; so I&amp;rsquo;m keen to get feedback on how it comes across.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;ll point everyone to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and set up spaces for people to write comments after the talk.  (That&amp;rsquo;s a given.)  But I&amp;rsquo;m sure that lots of people will have wireless-equipped laptops on the scene when I&amp;rsquo;m there.  Wikis aren&amp;rsquo;t the best for group communication in real-time, or joint simultaneous writing/editing of a document.  It strikes me now (after only thinking about it for a teensy bit) that I could host a document in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/&#34;&gt;SubEthaEdit&lt;/a&gt; for all of the mac users to take notes together.  That&amp;rsquo;s fine for collaborative notetaking.  People could use that as a way to take notes, write up questions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re coming to LC2005 or to ESSLLI2005, do you think that would be useful? If so, bring your computer along! Do you have anything else to recommend?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Flight of the Balloon</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/06/13/the_flight_of_the_balloon/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2005 10:28:55 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/06/13/the_flight_of_the_balloon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This Queen&amp;rsquo;s birthday holiday moning, cool and clear, was a perfect time for Zachary and me to fly our hot-air balloon.  The flight was short but glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/up1.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying a balloon like this is not completely straightforward.  You need to unfurl the balloon carefully, and make sure no bit touches the little burner on the ground (fuelled with cotton wool soaked in Methylated Spirits).  Zachary held the balloon carefully like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/prep.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the building in the background.  We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a park in Brunswick, and the air is still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balloon inflated quite rapidly.  I held the base steady, and Zachary held the top, letting go when it was obvious that the air was warm enough to keep the balloon inflated. The air inside warmed very quickly:  We let go, and it was away &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/launch.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gained altitude remarkably quickly.  (It was tricky to get the shots I did with the camera while we figured out which way it was going.)  The wind picked up and it drifted westwards as it gained height:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/up2.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got further west than we expected, given the still air at ground level.  Notice the building it&amp;rsquo;s near.   It made a gentle landing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/landing.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the roof of the factory of &amp;ldquo;Valve Tech Engineering.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so we learned another lesson in the transitory nature of all things.  &lt;em&gt;All flesh is grass, and all beauty is like the flower of the field.  The grass withers, the flower fades &amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Next travel thing: I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up at &lt;a href=&#34;http://skype.com&#34;&gt;skype.com&lt;/a&gt; and I have an account to make super-cheap voice calls home and almost anywhere else from the computer while overseas at least, when I&amp;rsquo;m connected to the internet.  It looks very well executed.  There are clients for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux, and at 1.7 euro cents a minute for calls to any landline (it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more expensive to call mobiles) in Western Europe, North America and Aus/NZ, it is a very good deal.  Then there&amp;rsquo;s the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s free if you&amp;rsquo;re making a Skype-to-Skype call.  If I were a &lt;a href=&#34;http://telstra.com&#34;&gt;telecommunications company making money from traditional telephony&lt;/a&gt;, I think I&amp;rsquo;d be worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a Skype account, let me know.  Look me up in the Skype directory to get my username.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taught my last classes for 2005.  I&amp;rsquo;m officially on study leave from July 1, until December 31.  We&amp;rsquo;re off on our journey from July 13.  First, Denmark, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking after Z, while Christine works with a colleague.  (Z and I plan to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/&#34;&gt;have some fun&lt;/a&gt; in our time there.)  Then I&amp;rsquo;m off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://eudoxos.math.uoa.gr/~lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt;, in Athens, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESSLLI2005&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh, and a week&amp;rsquo;s retreat on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iona.org.uk/&#34;&gt;the island of Iona&lt;/a&gt;, before heading down to Oxford, where we&amp;rsquo;ll both be Visiting Scholars at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iona.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Wolfson&lt;/a&gt;.  (You can keep track of our travels in the &amp;ldquo;Events&amp;rdquo; sidebar on this site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very exciting, but there&amp;rsquo;s heaps to do, and if I need advice on travel, I&amp;rsquo;ll post questions here.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m visiting the U.K. and Europe for six months, and I&amp;rsquo;ll want to use a mobile.  Should I buy a prepaid sim card for my (triband) phone that I&amp;rsquo;ll be bringing with me?  What should I do if I wanted to use my phone through Europe without paying too much in roaming fees?   Keep in mind that I&amp;rsquo;ll be arriving first on the continent, and then going the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any advice?  If you do, post in the comments on this entry.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/tag/tiger&#34;&gt;almost everyone else&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; very good upgrade to the operating system.  The system-wide search will be really handy.  It&amp;rsquo;s indexed all of my documents (which includes a 2.3GB library of PDF files of other people&amp;rsquo;s papers), so being able to find the 29 papers that mention &lt;em&gt;hypersequents&lt;/em&gt; (together with the 18 emails in my mail client) is just something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/spot.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;328&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m having even more fun, however, with organising my files using tagging.  I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that one later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m presenting a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/minitrue&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; at the staff seminar in the Philosophy Department at the University of Otago.   Given Charles Pigden&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/history.html#10&#34;&gt;delightful account of seminars at Otago&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think that Google&amp;rsquo;s new &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com&#34;&gt;search-inside-the-book&lt;/a&gt; service will prove to be quite handy to a researcher like me.  It&amp;rsquo;s not satisfactory to read through a book like that on the screen (especially when copyright restrictions do not permit you to keep going after a couple of pages of continuous reading), but it will be a boon to research to be able to search inside the &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com/print?id=8u-IU3xTHrcC&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;  for &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com/print?q=lattice&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;id=8u-IU3xTHrcC&#34;&gt;everywhere lattices are mentioned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea so much I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a &lt;a title=&#34;consequently.org/edit: Logic Books at print.google.com&#34; href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Logic_Books_at_print.google.com&#34;&gt;list of logic-related books&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page&#34;&gt;my wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  Feel free to browse the list, and to add to it any other logic-related works you find on &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com&#34;&gt;print.google.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>University Library Proxy Bookmarklet</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/03/12/university_library_proxy_bookmarklet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2005 21:02:43 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/03/12/university_library_proxy_bookmarklet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you do research on the web, and you browse around different sites for journals, seeing what&amp;rsquo;s been published, and what you should read.  Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; has online subscriptions for lots of these journals, so I can download the papers, file them, read them, etc.  It&amp;rsquo;s all very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to get from the site to actually download the paper.  Recently, our university introduced a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;proxy server&lt;/a&gt; as the means to keep track of whether someone attempting to download material under the banner of a University of Melbourne subscription is actually authorised to do so (i. e., is a member of staff or a student).  So, if I&amp;rsquo;m at a page for a journal like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mind.oupjournals.org/current.dtl&#34;&gt;http://mind.oupjournals.org/current.dtl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I want to download a paper like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mind.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/114/453/1&#34;&gt;http://mind.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/114/453/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to manually edit the address, by sticking &amp;ldquo;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&amp;rdquo; at the end of the hostname, before the path. (Between &amp;ldquo;.org&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;/cgi&amp;rdquo; here).  I am &lt;em&gt;lazy&lt;/em&gt; and I don&amp;rsquo;t like having to type &amp;ldquo;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&amp;rdquo; time and again when browsing the journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I use a little link I made &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;javascript:void(location.href=&#39;http://&#39;+location.host+&#39;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&#39;+location.pathname+location.search)&#34;&gt;+mate.lib&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; in the bookmarks bar of my browser, and whenever I&amp;rsquo;m on a site, it takes me directly to the relevant page viewed through proxy site, and I can download at will.  The bookmark is a simple bit of javascript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;javascript:void(location.href = 
      &#39;http://&#39; + location.host 
      + &#39;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&#39;
      + location.pathname
      + location.search)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it works like a charm.  One click, and you&amp;rsquo;re there.  Feel free to utilise a version of this yorself if &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usefulutilities.com/support/institutions.html&#34;&gt;your library&lt;/a&gt; uses an  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usefulutilities.com&#34;&gt;ezproxy server&lt;/a&gt; like ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;:  Don&amp;rsquo;t use the text I&amp;rsquo;ve displayed here for your own bookmarklet (it contains linebreaks and won&amp;rsquo;t be quite the right form for your browser).  Just drag this link &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;javascript:void(location.href=&#39;http://&#39;+location.host+&#39;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&#39;+location.pathname+location.search)&#34;&gt;+mate.lib&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; to your bookmarks bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2&lt;/em&gt;: Thanks to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2005/03/12/university_library_proxy_bookmarklet/index.php#c1449&#34;&gt;pointer from Richard Zach&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the link to preserve the search component of the URL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one thing I find comments on a website really good for: trawling for information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My spouse and I were talking over dessert this evening, over some &lt;em&gt;lemon delcious pudding&lt;/em&gt; that she had made.  She asked the question she asks every couple of years (when a self saucing pudding is made):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do self-saucing puddings work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They really are miraculous, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t got much of an idea of how the chemistry of these things makes them work.  A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22how+self-saucing+pudding+works%22&#34;&gt;cursory Googling&lt;/a&gt; reveals &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, and neither does a quick flick through &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684800012/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;On Food and Cooking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you help us?&lt;/p&gt;

On why one might allow them, or do without them. As you can see, I leave comments open here.  (Behind the scenes there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/&#34;&gt;hardworking comment spam filter&lt;/a&gt;.  Without that, this place would be deluged with spam.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand why one would want the place to yourself and do without comments.  However, if you do, and if you want your readers to &lt;em&gt;email you&lt;/em&gt; (as the author of &lt;a title=&#34;logicandlanguage.net: On Comments&#34; href=&#34;http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/on_comments_1.html#more&#34;&gt;logicandlanguage.net&lt;/a&gt; does) then &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; let the reader know your email address.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I sometimes catch the tram to get to or from the office, and usually it&amp;rsquo;s a not unpleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening was not one of the usual reasonably relaxing fifteen minute trips down Flemington Road and through Royal Park.  It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable how a violent scuffle between passengers can change the feeling throughout the tram.  There was pushing, shoving, curses and epithets, clutching at throats, and a tense standoff from the protagonists. Shocked stares, shy glances away, pleas of &amp;ldquo;calm down!&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;watch out!&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;cool it!&amp;rdquo; from the onlookers.  After the protagonists got off there were relieved sighs, a few tears, and a tram full of not-quite-returning-to-nomal people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; is lots of fun.  Being able to edit the page you&amp;rsquo;re on, and freely create new pages by making new links, does seem to foster a new way of writing.  It&amp;rsquo;ll be fun to see if any of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/161-438_in_2005&#34;&gt;students catch on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in typesetting manuscripts in LaTeX, you might be interested in the notes I wrote up this evening.  One on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/PnC_Page_Layout&#34;&gt;page layout&lt;/a&gt;, and the other on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/PnC_Example_prooftrees&#34;&gt;proof trees&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in playing around on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, feel free.  Start by looking at the recommendations on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/How_To_Participate&#34;&gt;how to participate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Matt and Nick talk Dialetheism</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/01/10/matt_and_nick_talk_dialetheism/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2005 21:57:09 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/01/10/matt_and_nick_talk_dialetheism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt Carter and Nick Trakakis are &lt;a href=&#34;http://cogitation.braininavat.net/dialetheism.htm&#34;&gt;arguing over dialetheism&lt;/a&gt;.  What&amp;rsquo;s dialetheism?  It&amp;rsquo;s the view that some contradictory pairs of statements are true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that Nick is trying the line that contradictions (conjunctions of the form &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;) are &lt;em&gt;meaningless&lt;/em&gt;.  I always find it hard to judge claims of meaninglessness (since I don&amp;rsquo;t have on hand a general theory of meaningfulness), but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great deal of sympathy for that line of argument.  I would have thought that it was because we &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt; the meaning the statement &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; that we could see that it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Nick&amp;rsquo;s in good company here.  His view that contradictions (and tautologies) has proponents like the Wittgenstein of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/tlph.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying being back at work, but I seem to be procrastinating rather badly.  Instead of writing my grant application and getting through my growing pile of emails, I&amp;rsquo;m doing &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blame this on three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to deal with my emails and my grant application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently purchased two black-cover 100 page A4 spiral bound notebooks with nice blank white paper to scribble in, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://hans.presto.tripod.com/cat012.html&#34;&gt;cheap disposable fountain pens&lt;/a&gt; to scribble in them.  One notepad is for writing notes on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc&#34;&gt;draft book&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is for general scribbles and ideas.  The move from A5 (my old notebooks) to A4 is astonishing for getting ideas down.  A5 didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me at all well, compared to the A4 notebooks.  (I will resist the obvious extrapolation that an A3, or &amp;ndash; heaven forbid &amp;ndash; A2 or A1 size notebook would be spectacularly good.)  The ideas seem to be coming thicker and faster.  I recommend both the pen and the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas themselves, at the moment, simply fun to think about.  Yesterday and today I managed to sort through some ideas for Gentzen-style sequent calculi for normal modal logics.  The result is superficially like existing &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=hypersequent&#34;&gt;hypersequent&lt;/a&gt; calculi, but in fact it is much closer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=display+logic&#34;&gt;Display Logic&lt;/a&gt; (as you might expect, given my background and interests), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=calculus+of+structures&#34;&gt;Calculus of Structures&lt;/a&gt;.   The ideas of today and yesterday, were getting the sequent structures right.  It turns out that what you want &amp;ndash; to represent things cleanly &amp;ndash; is a simple linear notation for directed trees.  Call me mad, but I enjoy fiddling about constructing such things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I must get the paper written.  Before I do that, however, I have a big pile of email &amp;ndash; and a grant application &amp;ndash; to wrestle with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m back in the office, and back at work after my short Christmas/New Year break.  It&amp;rsquo;ll be time to plough through that 45-email inbox, and see what else is waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started converting the news item archive pages to the new template.  Expect more fiddling as I try to get them looking clearer.  (They seem a bit too &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt; right now.)  There are changes under the hood to commenting too: I now use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://typekey.com&#34;&gt;TypeKey&lt;/a&gt; registration for comments.  If you have a TypeKey identity, use it.  If not, you can either &lt;a href=&#34;http://typekey.com&#34;&gt;sign up there&lt;/a&gt;, or wait for your comments to be vetted by me before they show up on the site.  This measure seems necessary to avoid all of the unsolicited comment spam this site has been suffering over the last months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if anything isn&amp;rsquo;t working for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2005 Redesign</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2005/01/01/2005_redesign/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My redesign for 2005 is in progress now.  After some problems (I managed to delete the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; page in a fit of cutting-and-pasting) I have some things on the way.  There are lots of changes behind the scene.  The linklist in the right column is now powered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;, which is wonderful.  The sidebars (left and right) contain other information, such as recent comments, recent udates on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; page, and a little diary of events, past and present. Figuring out what goes where is all done automatically by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://movabletype.org&#34;&gt;weblog software I use&lt;/a&gt;.  I hope you find the new design of the front page useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve only got the front page working as of tonight, and it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get to bed.  The rest will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if the front page has any bugs when viewed in your browser.  Leave a message in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope that your 2005 is a fruitful one.  If there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unicef.org.au/Donate-Appeals-Detail.asp?AppealID=7&#34;&gt;something you can do&lt;/a&gt; to respond to the crisis in the wake of the tsunami crisis, then &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oxfam.org.au/world/emergencies/asia_tsunami.html&#34;&gt;do it&lt;/a&gt;.  It seems like the best thing that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; could be doing with money right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s going on around here</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/12/14/whats_going_on_around_here/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather busy for the last little while, as the absence from the website might indicate.  Here is a list of what&amp;rsquo;s been happening, which involves not a little bit of trumpet-blowing, because a lot of the news has been good and it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I spent an enjoyable (if rather &lt;em&gt;wet&lt;/em&gt;) week in Canberra, touring the sights with Zachary in the mornings, and teaching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://lss.rsise.anu.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Logic Summer School&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoons.  Going through a rapid-fire course covering Turing machines, register machines, recursive functions, the halting problem, diagonalisation, formal arithmetic, representability, and G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s incompleteness results in 5 hours flat was a challenge.  I learned something setting it up and I hope the students learned something in the listening.  (They laughed at my jokes, which was very polite.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was looking after Z, C was at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://regnet.anu.edu.au/events/GovNet_RegNet_Conf/announcement.htm&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, at which her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0199264074/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;most recent book&lt;/a&gt; had its Australian launch.  Z and I crashed the launch party at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse&#34;&gt;University House&lt;/a&gt;, which was great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately upon our return to Melbourne, we went to some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livingroom.org.au/blog/archives/livingroom_wedding_1.php&#34;&gt;friends&amp;rsquo; wedding&lt;/a&gt; up near Marysville. The drive through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visitvictoria.com/displayObject.cfm/objectid.00064EAD-739A-1EF6-9E6080C476A90000/vvt.vhtml&#34;&gt;Black Spur&lt;/a&gt; would have been nice in and of itself. The touching wedding ceremony and socialising with friends out in attractive country was almost an excellent bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going away I heard three bits of good news.  First, I&amp;rsquo;m now on the editorial board of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  (My membership doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be on their website as yet, but it should be sometime soon.)  This was the site of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp&#34;&gt;first academic publication&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m chuffed to be on the editorial board now.  Send good papers to the journal.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great print journal with an enlightened open access policy for its &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl&#34;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; (you get free access to papers older than five years).  The online archive goes back to &lt;em&gt;1960&lt;/em&gt;, which is seriously impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last round of ARC research grants was announced a little while ago and my last application with Graham Priest and Allen Hazen received &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/By_State-University_2005.pdf&#34;&gt;funding in the current round&lt;/a&gt;.  So, we&amp;rsquo;re receiving support for our projects, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have been elected as a Fellow of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.humanities.org.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Academy of the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.humanities.org.au/NewFellowsMediaRelease.PDF.pdf&#34;&gt;citation&lt;/a&gt; says exaggeratedly flattering things about me.  Thanks to everyone who put my name forward.  I&amp;rsquo;m chuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take these shoes&lt;br /&gt;
Click clacking down some dead end street&lt;br /&gt;
Take these shoes&lt;br /&gt;
And make them fit&lt;br /&gt;
Take this shirt&lt;br /&gt;
Polyester white trash made in nowhere&lt;br /&gt;
Take this shirt&lt;br /&gt;
And make it clean, clean&lt;br /&gt;
Take this soul&lt;br /&gt;
Stranded in some skin and bones&lt;br /&gt;
Take this soul&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u2.com/htdaab-lyrics/#Track11&#34;&gt;And make it sing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u2.com/htdaab-lyrics/&#34;&gt;not a bad album&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u2.com/htdaab-lyrics/#Track11&#34;&gt;not a bad song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just bought some sheet music for the first time in 18 years or so.  Let&amp;rsquo;s hope my violin technique is up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.universaledition.com/truman/frontend/439_ue13360.pdf&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  I know I can play the &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt; (or close approximations to them).  It&amp;rsquo;s sustaining the technique for 10 minutes that I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2005 we&amp;rsquo;re planning to travel, on sabbatical.  The C, G and Z show will be based in Oxford for &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ox/terms.html&#34;&gt;Michaelmas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before arriving in Oxford, we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing some European touring.  C will be visiting a colleague in Denmark.  I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully be presenting at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://eudoxos.math.uoa.gr/~lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Athens (July 28 to August 3), and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/&#34;&gt;ESSLLI2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Edinburgh (I should be on in the second week, August 15 to 19).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;One stroke of good fortune today.  In a shopping trip with Z this afternoon, while looking for a &lt;em&gt;Super Secret Present&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jbhifi.com.au/&#34;&gt;JB Hi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; I found a set of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.headphone.com/layout.php?topicID=3&amp;amp;subTopicID=26&amp;amp;productID=0020080497&#34;&gt;Sennheiser HD 497&lt;/a&gt;s on sale.  Picking these &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000065BPC/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;sweet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epinions.com/Sennheiser_HD_497_Headphones_Headphones/display_~reviews&#34;&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt; up for $15 was very very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially considering that this was approximately 80% off the list price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and they&amp;rsquo;re very nice headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

Sad news tonight, with the conservatives returned with an increased majority here in Australia.  Most worrying is the fact that their representation is increased in the Senate. We&amp;rsquo;re going to have an interesting few years ahead.  (Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the forces for succession develop: Costello, Abbott, Turnbull&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering where this site was over the last couple of days: it turns out that both of the domain name servers that were registered for this site are in &lt;em&gt;Florida&lt;/em&gt;.  Not the best place to be over the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now got three DNS machines registered for this domain, and they&amp;rsquo;re not all in the same continent, so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s more reliable now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>October 9 Election</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/08/29/october_9_election/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2004 20:46:26 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/08/29/october_9_election/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Our Federal Election is to be held on October 9.  Our current &lt;a href=&#34;http://theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/29/1093717818471.html&#34;&gt;Prime Minister says that this election is about &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m glad that the unannounced election campaign is over and the &lt;em&gt;announced&lt;/em&gt; one is on its way.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think that we&amp;rsquo;ll get a government that we can, or should &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; in the result of this election, and I think that trust is rather a silly attitude to hold towards our elected representatives.  No, we should keep a keen eye on them, and get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; worried if we find that we start trusting them.  That&amp;rsquo;s about the time that they&amp;rsquo;ll abuse it.  It&amp;rsquo;s not that policians are any worse than the rest of us.  It&amp;rsquo;s that the position of power brings with it so many opportunities for abuse of that power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the coming election, I can&amp;rsquo;t make a sensible prediction.  It seems like it will be close.  What worries me is that if the Howard/Costello Government is returned, then they will take this as an endorsement of the way that they have treated the public service as an arm of the party in power, inflaming insecurity and scapegoating asylum seekers assiduously ensuring that we do not understand the plight of those locked up without trial on our shores (and off them), mangled relations between government and our indigenous people, and cynically throwing buckets of money around in order to bribe voters in the leadup to this election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; take this current election to be about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling like redesigning this site, yet again.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot about the design here I like, yet it&amp;rsquo;s not quite &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; for some of what I want to do.  If you have any likes or dislikes about this place, please leave a comment here.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got some ideas of what the redesign might feature, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get rid of anything that my three regular readers appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s been happening around here</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/08/26/whats_been_happening_around_here/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2004 11:03:31 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/08/26/whats_been_happening_around_here/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;suppose&lt;/em&gt; I should post something, even though the urge to post seems to have gone for a while over the last months.  Let me fill you in on what&amp;rsquo;s been happening around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing work with Mark Lance, who&amp;rsquo;s been visiting the Philosophy Department for a couple of months to do research with me.  This has been immensely productive.  We seem to have a new story to tell about how to get semantics out of pragmatics.  Once you get a general story about the normative significance of &lt;em&gt;acts&lt;/em&gt; right, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to tell a general story about the normative significiance of &lt;em&gt;speech acts&lt;/em&gt;.  Or so it appears to us.  Expect to see a paper draft over in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; area before too long.  If all goes well, it seems like we&amp;rsquo;ll be committed to a book length project on this in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;em&gt;loving&lt;/em&gt; my teaching.  Just doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/&#34;&gt;intro logic&lt;/a&gt; has been a dream, and the students seem to be keen and bright, and the lectures have been fun.  That they manage to (1) laugh at my jokes, (2) listen to the content, (3) engage and ask smart questions, makes teaching very easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling a few minor illnesses over the last few weeks, just as winter slowly battles with the emerging spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve assembled a few random pieces from IKEA, slowly making our home more homely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing up a couple of talks for the logic-seminars here on proof shape.  The work on quantifiers and modal operators seems to be stabilising, and I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I know how to best state the formal results.  Alas, the seminar room won&amp;rsquo;t have digital projection, and I won&amp;rsquo;t have completed making digital slides with &lt;a href=&#34;http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;beamer&lt;/a&gt; anyway, so I&amp;rsquo;m resorting to the old multicolour pens and overhead transparencies.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t done &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C, Z and I have been enjoying becoming a part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livingroom.org.au/home.php&#34;&gt;Living Room&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fighting my way through administrative tasks, such as applying for study leave in Semester 2, 2005, and completing my probation report, so that I get confirmed in my position here and not booted out of the university, and other tasks too tedious to recite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for me for now.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be back with something more philosophically illuminating later, when I write up a quick response here to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.oup.co.uk/ajphil/hdb/Volume_82/Issue_03/820409.sgm.abs.html&#34;&gt;Nicole Wyatt&amp;rsquo;s nice paper&lt;/a&gt; criticising JC&amp;rsquo;s and my position on logical pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Parent/Teacher Interview</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/07/26/parentteacher_interview/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning I had my first ever &amp;ldquo;parent/teacher interview,&amp;rdquo; with Z&amp;rsquo;s carers at childcare.  They seem to like him, and he generally likes them (though Z is choosy when it comes to who counts as his &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;: the select group is pretty small at the moment).  So now I know how they take him to be going on emotional, social, cognitive and motor development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And according to the carers (who have scales and developmental criteria and all of that kind of stuff) he&amp;rsquo;s going pretty darn well.  So, I suppose we have passed this &amp;ldquo;test.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Elsewhere is lots of fun, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of the way through, we seem to be having a very good time.  I&amp;rsquo;ll report back with some highlights later.  But now I&amp;rsquo;m off to another talk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Off North</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This last couple of weeks has been super-busy-hectic.  Z and I fly up north this afternoon for a family visit.  On Sunday I go off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/aap2004/&#34;&gt;AAP Conference&lt;/a&gt; at South Molle, and Z stays with his Granddad for a couple of days, to be joined by his mum who returns from her little Europe conference trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One piece of advice: If you&amp;rsquo;re preparing a conference presentation with simple dot-and-line pictures, and you&amp;rsquo;d like them to be presented &lt;em&gt;dynamically&lt;/em&gt;, then the LaTeX packages &lt;a href=&#34;http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;beamer and pgf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/acdei_talk.pdf&#34;&gt;are your friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organising Academic Papers</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/06/21/organising_academic_papers/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is a question which is much more sensible to ask than you might otherwise think: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://freelancepropaganda.com/archives/MP3vPDF.pdf&#34;&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t I manage academic papers like MP3s?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (the link is to a pdf of a paper by James Howison and Abby Goodrum).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &amp;ldquo;paper archive&amp;rdquo; is a fairly large 2GB (not as big as my &amp;ldquo;music archive&amp;rdquo;, I suppose) with about 6000 papers, and it&amp;rsquo;s catergorised under author (approx 2000 of those).  If anyone can produce a way that enables me to sort, label, filter, slice and dice these just as smoothly as &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; does my mp3s, I&amp;rsquo;ll be a very happy academic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slow Period</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/06/18/slow_period/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/06/18/slow_period/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a slow period on the &amp;rsquo;net for me in the next little while.  My creaky powerbook seems to have developed yet another fault (now its AirPort connection is completely bung, so I&amp;rsquo;m only online at home when I directly plug in to the ADSL modem, which boots off the other users of the connection).  This, together with the wonky right hinge and the intermittent backlight might mean that it&amp;rsquo;s time to put the poor thing in for a service to see what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to shoehorn as many files as possible into our family&amp;rsquo;s surplus-to-requirements iBook (though the step down to the small screen, the slow processor and the cramped memory will not be good), but I have rather too many things to do, and I&amp;rsquo;m not looking forward to the experience.  I can&amp;rsquo;t be out of computer action while my powerbook is in for a service, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really afford the time to do the brain transplant.  That means I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t afford the time to be posting here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/06/17/musical_taste/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no accounting for musical taste.  This morning Z was a little upset. I decided to put on some music for him.  First selection: &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=341061&#34;&gt;Big Red Car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little voice responds, with a tremor.  &amp;ldquo;Dad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask, &amp;ldquo;Zack, what is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want this on.  I want &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; music.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;OK.&amp;rdquo; Takes CD out.  Replaces it.  &amp;ldquo;Is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ozmusiconline.com.au/product_info.php/cPath/190093_190083_190088_190076_190783/products_id/333046?osCsid=b22bab9d670495188ce4969e15349660&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; any better?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sounds much brighter.  &amp;ldquo;Good!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/06/14/no_writing_implements/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d comment on &lt;em&gt;Big Brother&lt;/em&gt;, but when I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/13/1087065031443.html?oneclick=true&#34;&gt;learned that the &lt;em&gt;inmates&lt;/em&gt; aren&amp;rsquo;t even allowed &lt;em&gt;writing implements&lt;/em&gt; inside&lt;/a&gt;, I am convinced that the place is completely inhumane.  I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine a life where I can&amp;rsquo;t write, whether on paper or on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that the restriction serves a couple of goals of the producer.  (1) no passing notes from inmate to inmate: all communication must be picked up by the microphones. (2) no writing of diaries (and all that that entails).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, hey, Merlin Luck&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/14/1087065042010.html&#34;&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; was great.  Good on him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is my &lt;em&gt;favourite&lt;/em&gt; paper of the last few years.  At last, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished wrestling with the diagrams in the paper and &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/gndl/&#34;&gt;The Geometry of Non-Distributive Logics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; can now see light of day.  My superb and long-suffering co-author &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unica.it/~paoli/&#34;&gt;Francesco Paoli&lt;/a&gt; and I have been working on this on-and-off since we met and talked about this material in the middle of 2001.  Francesco provided a great draft, which sat in my pile of things to do for altogether too long as I tried to get the diagrams to look legible.  Anyway, after some gentle reminding from Francesco, and after a few late nights and debugging &lt;a href=&#34;http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html&#34;&gt;MetaPost&lt;/a&gt; code, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished a draft of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the first completed technical work in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;proof project&lt;/a&gt;, to go alongside &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/assertiondenialparadox/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/lnclem/&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adcei/&#34;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just miss out on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=46828&#34;&gt;Zermelo&lt;/a&gt; who was a student of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=11370&#34;&gt;Fuchs&lt;/a&gt; (a great^6 grandfather), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=29561&#34;&gt;Cantor&lt;/a&gt;, who was a student of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=7486&#34;&gt;Weierstrass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=18331&#34;&gt;Kummer&lt;/a&gt; (both great^7 grandfathers of mine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I learned of this just now through my academic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=35034&#34;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; who learned it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=15663&#34;&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a household, we&amp;rsquo;re running at an annual rate somewhere between 30 and 40 tonnes. (The indeterminacy here is chiefly due to my ignorance about the number of flights we&amp;rsquo;re making this year.)  Our car useage is a pretty skimpy 1.8 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine reminded me that when talking about epistemic logic one should, of course, cite Donald Rumsfeld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3254852.stm&#34;&gt;famous&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;infamous&lt;/em&gt;?) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2002/t02122002_t212sdv2.html&#34;&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt; about the known knowns, the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns.  (Does the fact that he didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the unknown knowns mean that he implicitly endorses the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=kk+thesis&#34;&gt;KK thesis&lt;/a&gt;?  Who can tell?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/notevery&#34;&gt;take a look at the paper&lt;/a&gt; (the changes from 0.85 to 0.9 are mainly bugfixes and exposition changes, no pictures yet, though I promise they will come &lt;em&gt;someday&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/notevery&#34;&gt;let me know what you think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Haskell and Logic</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/05/10/haskell_and_logic/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/05/10/haskell_and_logic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This looks very nice indeed: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/HR/&#34;&gt;The Haskell Road&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a textbook on elementary logic, mathematics and programming, based around my favourite programming language &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the textbook in my introductory computer science course, long ago in 1986.  If it were, I may have fallen in love with computing and never become a philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parenthetical remark 1&lt;/em&gt;: How a textbook based on Haskell, a computer programming language that wasn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org/haskell-history.html&#34;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; in 1986 is a matter for counterfactual speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parenthetical remark 2&lt;/em&gt;: I did do a section on Miranda in a &lt;em&gt;Declarative Programming&lt;/em&gt; course in my second year, in 1987.  I see &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org/haskell-history.html&#34;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; that this was pretty cutting-edge stuff.  By this time, however, the mystique of late night (and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; night) debugging sessions had well-and-truly worn off, and I&amp;rsquo;ve become a philosopher, after a brief stint trying to become a mathematician instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Christine received an &lt;a href=&#34;http://nadelectronics.com/cd_players/C521BEE_framset.htm&#34;&gt;early Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day present&lt;/a&gt;.  The NAD C521BEE &lt;a href=&#34;http://nadelectronics.com/reviews/C521BEE_0903_framset.htm&#34;&gt;sounds gorgeous&lt;/a&gt;.  A weclome bonus is that it plays every CD we feed it, unlike our dearly departed Yamaha CD player, which served us well for the last 10 years or so, but it started giving up the ghost (being very picky about what CDs it felt like playing) over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if only our &lt;a href=&#34;http://207.228.230.231/info/NAD_701.pdf&#34;&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; would actually show us the frequency it&amp;rsquo;s tuned to on its front panel!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/04/21/the_ajl_is_on_the_register/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just heard that the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/&#34;&gt;AJL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will soon appear in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au&#34;&gt;DEST&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm#journals&#34;&gt;Register of Refereed Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  This makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are an editor of a refereed journal, please take the time to get your journal registered on this list.  (It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm#journals&#34;&gt;submission process&lt;/a&gt; is straightforward.)  If you are on this list, then Australians who publish in your journal will not have to bug you for a letter indicating that your journal peer-referees its articles. (Why?  Because peer review makes an article &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt; in DEST&amp;rsquo;s scheme assigning brownie points for research output, which means more &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; for your institution, hence the need to prove it.) So, being on the register saves you, the journal editor (or your admin staff if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have any, I suppose) time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being on the register will also make you attractive to Australian authors.  I note that precious few philosophy or journals are yet on the register.  Consider this a plea to get more on that list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Do you want to come to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Melbourne Philosophy Department&lt;/a&gt; and teach my &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161246/pub/&#34;&gt;Reasoning and Uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; course for me for Semester 2, 2004?  I&amp;rsquo;ve got some research money, and I&amp;rsquo;m using it to buy out some teaching to give me more time to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;.  Check the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/general/positions.html&#34;&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in applying for the position.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve got any questions, contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be tutoring positions in my &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/&#34;&gt;Intro Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; course too, though current postgraduates in the department are a high priority for these tutoring positions, and I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ve got enough candidates to fill every slot for the next time it&amp;rsquo;s taught.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Busy/Quiet Period 2, and email</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/04/17/busyquiet_period_2_and_email/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2004 19:42:39 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/04/17/busyquiet_period_2_and_email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Now that Christine&amp;rsquo;s back from overseas, I seem to have entered &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/30/busyquiet_period&#34;&gt;another busy/quiet period&lt;/a&gt;.  In the last week we have had Z&amp;rsquo;s birthday (he&amp;rsquo;s now a precocious three-year-old), Easter, our midsemester break, various small house renovation things, and catching up on previously unattended email.  (The inbox is down to two items as of this afternoon, both of which came in today, so that&amp;rsquo;s going fairly well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of email, it&amp;rsquo;s been interesting to see how the topic of &lt;a href=&#34;http://raelity.org/computers/internet/email/archive.html&#34;&gt;email filing practices&lt;/a&gt; is in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.antisleep.com/archives/2002-11-25_0184.php&#34;&gt;aether&lt;/a&gt;, now that &lt;a href=&#34;http://gmail.google.com&#34;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt; is there, tempting you to archive all of your email and use &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; to get at it, instead of filing it away in different folders.  My own email folder hieararchy is slowly spiralling out of control: the act of asking &amp;ldquo;where should I file this?&amp;rdquo; (and answering it) is becoming stressful, and burrowing through folders to find things (did I put it in the &lt;em&gt;Teaching&lt;/em&gt; folder orthe &lt;em&gt;Admin&lt;/em&gt; folder or&amp;hellip;?) is tedious. I am tempted to ditch the folder hierarchy completely and stick everything in an archive folder and let the pretty competent search box in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/&#34;&gt;mail client&lt;/a&gt; dig up what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I won&amp;rsquo;t do that yet.  I&amp;rsquo;d like two features I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have in my mail client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labels or categories&lt;/em&gt;: I want to label all of my correspondence to do with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/&#34;&gt;AJL&lt;/a&gt; (to pick a salient example) with an &amp;ldquo;AJL&amp;rdquo; label, so that I can pull them out when I want to see all of my AJL correspondence in one pile.  (Not all AJL email contains the text &amp;lsquo;AJL&amp;rsquo;, so searching for it does not necessarily help.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Configurable Views&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;d like a &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; folder of everything labelled &amp;ldquo;AJL.&amp;rdquo;  When I&amp;rsquo;m collaborating with Person &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d like a virtual folder containing of all of my email to or from Person &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.  And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, different mail clients out there have some combination of these things.  The scary thing, when I think about it, is that what I&amp;rsquo;m asking for is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/&#34;&gt;iPhoto&lt;/a&gt; for my mail archive.  (Though without the rating feature.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to rate my emails from 1 to 5 stars!)  Maybe Apple will add these features to the venerable Mail application.  Maybe someone else will build a robust mail client for Mac OS X with the combination of fast content-based search, arbitrary labels and configurable views.  If you hear of one, please let me know.  My 660MB ~/Library/Mail/ folder and I will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were student protests on campus today, over the decision.  The University&amp;rsquo;s council chambers are in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/general/&#34;&gt;our building&lt;/a&gt;, and the building was locked down from 11:30 this morning, in preparation for the protests.  (We were asked to leave the building for the rest of the day.) The council met this afternoon, but, despite the security guards and police presence ringing the building, council met elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technical &#39;Support&#39;</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/04/04/technical_support/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2004 10:07:52 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/04/04/technical_support/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Are computer technical &amp;ldquo;support&amp;rdquo; positions staffed by robots?  Or are they simply underqualified, underpaid people in call/email centres?  Probably the latter, as far as my experience (limited to just one case, of course) is concerned.  Let me cast my support request out to cyberspace to see if I receive a more useful response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just purchased an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000C9ZJV/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;HP PSC 1350&lt;/a&gt;, a little all-in-one inkjet printer, scanner and copier.  It&amp;rsquo;s very nice.  It prints, it scans, it copies, it&amp;rsquo;s very small and fits snugly on my bookshelf near my desk at home. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit loud, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m using it with my Powerbook G4, running Mac OS X 10.3.3.  All of the information I have received indicates that it comes with OCR software.  However, none seems to have been installed with the HP installer.  Have I been &lt;a href=&#34;http://h20015.www2.hp.com/en/documentIndex.jhtml?reg=&amp;plc=&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodId=hppsc1350a306888&amp;cat=use&amp;docparent=78701037&amp;pagetype=78701036&#34;&gt;deceived&lt;/a&gt;?  Was my box missing some software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first response from HP tech support was what you might have expected from a simple pattern matching algorithm.  I described my problem as I did above, indicating how I&amp;rsquo;d installed the software, and saying that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the ReadIRIS OCR software, and that in the HP scanner software there was no &amp;ldquo;send this to a text editor&amp;rdquo; option available (contrary to the printed and online manuals).  The response (taking the form of some parts of the manual sent back to me) contained no indication that my query was actually read beyond the first phrase saying &amp;ldquo;I cannot perform OCR with my scanner.&amp;rdquo; The part where they said &amp;ldquo;And you can perform OCR from within the ReadIRIS application&amp;rdquo; when I had already said that the application wasn&amp;rsquo;t installed was a particularly nice example of the failure of comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent a second query, reiterating the problem and indicating why their response missed the point.  I am yet to receive a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m at your mercy.  Does anyone here have any experience with this?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a research project for you.  Look at the physical interpretation of intuitionistic logic in the Markopoulou and Bell papers I &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/30/what_the_universe_looks_like_from_the_inside&#34;&gt;mentioned yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, mix in Nuel Belnap&amp;rsquo;s really interesting account of an indeterministic relativistic universe in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001003/&#34;&gt;Branching Space-time&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and the Thomason point/history semantics for temporal logic motivated and justified in Belnap and Green&amp;rsquo;s wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.virginia.edu/~msg6m/trl.pdf&#34; title=&#34;A 2.9MB PDF file: download at your peril&#34;&gt;Indeterminism and The Thin Red Line&lt;/a&gt;, and stir thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you cook up.  I think it could be really &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact, you could come &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as a graduate student and do a project just like this one.  This would be a great M.A. or Ph.D. thesis topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The mathematically/logically/physically minded among you should take a look at &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9811053&#34; title=&#34;[gr-qc/9811053]&#34;&gt;The internal description of a causal set: What the universe looks like from the inside&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/researchers/view_bio.cfm?id=18&#34;&gt;Fotini Markopoulou&lt;/a&gt;.  (Found from a reference to in &lt;a href=&#34;http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Two%20Approaches%20to%20Modelling%20the%20Universe.pdf&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Causal%20sets%20and%20Frame-Valued%20Set%20Theory.pdf&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell&#34;&gt;John Bell&lt;/a&gt;, which was found in turn by way of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/tar/Archives/002689.html&#34;&gt;Brian Weatherson&lt;/a&gt;.)  This is interesting, deep material at the intersection between the semantics for non-classical logics and difficult physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&#34;http://cgpg.gravity.psu.edu/online/Html/Seminars/Fall1998/Markopoulou/Slides/s01.html&#34;&gt;handwritten slides&lt;/a&gt; are available for a talk she gave on the topic.  Handwritten slides from talks given by mathematicians or physicists are often very revealing: they present the flavour of the material succinctly and often with flair and character.  Will this survive the transition to digital production of slides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a snippets entry, but by the time I got to paragraph 2, I realised it was time for it to move left.]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If I post anything here between now and Easter, consider yourself lucky.  Christine (my omnicompetent spouse) is enjoying well-earned time away from the house while taking a research/conference/catch-up-with-friends trip to London, Oxford and Glasgow.  I, therefore, am enjoying even more time with my son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that any posts here are either the result of sheer good fortune or a sign of excessive procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brandom on Philosophy and the University</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/24/brandom_on_philosophy_and_the_university/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2004 22:02:53 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/24/brandom_on_philosophy_and_the_university/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Robert Brandom recently addressed the trustees at the University of Pittsburgh (where he works).  His talk addressed different issues, including the history of the Pitt philosophy department, the role of a research university, and how we ought to conceive of the relationship between the university and its students. Go &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umc.pitt.edu:591/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;amp;-lay=a&amp;amp;-format=d.html&amp;amp;storyid=1962&amp;amp;-Find&#34;&gt;read this extract of the speech&lt;/a&gt; and then come back here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re back?  Good.  Here are some thoughts of mine.  Use the comments section to add thoughts of your own (or to express disagreement with mine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any idea how I could go about convincing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;my university&lt;/a&gt; that every undergraduate student should take at least one philosophy subject? That would &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; change things here to a considerable degree.  We teach nowhere near that fraction of the undergraduate student body, despite having a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/firstyear.html&#34;&gt;very wide range&lt;/a&gt; of introductory subjects.  Melbourne prides itself on giving its students a liberal education, but we don&amp;rsquo;t do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; well at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note Brandom&amp;rsquo;s claim that the fact that each senior academic teaches one intro course each year (of two hours contact a week) gives these senior philosophers the heaviest load among cognate disciplines in the university.  Here, our undergraduate (including honours) teaching load has been 2+2 (two courses a semester, both semesters).  Typically it&amp;rsquo;s one first year subject, two second-third year subjects, and one honours subject.  This is pretty good for the discipline Australia-wide, I think, but it&amp;rsquo;s high when we compare ourselves to our colleagues in the rest of the Arts Faculty.  We are attempting a restructure of our anarchic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/&#34;&gt;course offerings&lt;/a&gt; which will give us (if all goes well) very nearly a 2+1 load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most interesting point &amp;ndash; to me, at least &amp;ndash; was the description of the way that many students don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate being made to take a philosophy course.  Despite this, they get good course evaluations, presumably indicating that the students enjoy it and have &amp;ldquo;come around&amp;rdquo; by the end.  He makes the following inference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This underlines what is wrong with thinking of our students as customers, whose desires ought to drive our offerings. If we just give the students what they want, half of them would do nothing but channel-surf through undemanding courses on the symbolism of the Matrix movies and what the popularity of reality TV says about contemporary culture&amp;ndash;with lots of video-viewing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat better model than that of commercial customer is that of professional client, in relation, for instance, to a doctor or lawyer. No one with any sense goes to their counselor and says: Prescribe this drug for me in this dosage, or file a lawsuit for me under this section of the Uniform Commercial Code. One goes instead for access to a different kind of judgment and advice, which one wants to take account of a whole range of possibilities and constraints initially visible only to the professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what struck me most heavily.  I agree with the sentiment, that students are here to be informed, and to be informed is, at least partially, to be &lt;em&gt;formed&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; to put yourself (not uncritically) at the mercy (at least in part) of your teacher.  You take your teacher to be an authority: not an infallible authority, of course, but an authority at least in a provisional sense.  We can&amp;rsquo;t think of students as mere &amp;ldquo;customers&amp;rdquo; in this game because of this kind of relationship.  This much seems good sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the attitude that &amp;ldquo;half of my students would prefer to just slack off&amp;rdquo; strikes me as condescending.  But is there a way of expressing the point without being condescending?  Am I hopelessly na&amp;iuml;ve in thinking that most of my students actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to learn?  Maybe this is the happy flip-side of our status as an elective subject for anyone on campus.  No-one is forced to take philosophy subjects, so everyone who does &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, they are my thoughts. &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/24/brandom_on_philosophy_and_the_university&#34;&gt;What do you think?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today I received offprints of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pev/&#34;&gt;Paraconsistency Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; an article I wrote quite some time ago (it was essentially finished in 2001).  It appears in the &lt;em&gt;2002&lt;/em&gt; issue of the Journal, yet it has only just appeared on my desk.  This comical state of affairs continues when you look at the bottom of &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org:80/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.ndjfl/1074290713&#34;&gt;the published article&lt;/a&gt; where it indicates that the paper was &amp;ldquo;Received February 13, 2002; accepted February 5, 2003; printed December 19, 2003,&amp;rdquo; yet at the top of the page it says &amp;ldquo;Volume 43, Number 3, 2002.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the offprints of the article &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.  Clearly, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a very fine journal indeed) is fighting a severe backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a matter only for tea-room (and weblog) conversation and nothing more were it not for one thing.  Australian academics publish under the shadow of a stringent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm&#34;&gt;data collection regime&lt;/a&gt; according to which everything we get published in a year is collected early in the following year, categorised, and the resulting figures help determine the amount of research funding your university will receive.  Funding is always tight, and you want to ensure that your publications pull their weight and your institution receives its proper &amp;ldquo;reward.&amp;rdquo; If something comes in &lt;em&gt;too late&lt;/em&gt; for the census for the previous year (as it almost certainly seems to have in this case, as the census date has passed) it does not count, and the University receives nothing.    The University is, understandably, quite keen to receive funding on the basis of &amp;ldquo;research performance,&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree that if that&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;re being funded, the funding levels should bear some significant relation to the research actually carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, no doubt, will influence future funding decisions for academics like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Addendum: It turns out that this article &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be counted for the 2003 census. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Research Office&lt;/a&gt; was able to add it as a late entry.]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday night I went to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sonyclassics.com/fogofwar/&#34;&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; with my brother-in-law, who is visiting Melbourne for a few days.  I was absolutely knackered (must have been something to do with staying up until 1:30 that morning getting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logical_pluralism/&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; away to the publisher), but I managed to stay conscious for 95% of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a striking movie in a number of different ways. One I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen mentioned in any of the reviews I read before the movie was the beautiful &lt;a href=&#34;http://rgable.typepad.com/aworks/2004/01/the_fog_of_war_.html&#34;&gt;Philip Glass soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;.  It suited the movie down to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/18/publishing_a_book&#34;&gt;discussion on book publishing&lt;/a&gt; continuing.  I have 11 comments, over half of whom are written by people who are not me.  I like having smart readers who have opinions and are able to articulate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amirrorclear.net/&#34;&gt;Toby&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s prompting, I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuffing around with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/2004.css&#34;&gt;stylesheet&lt;/a&gt; for this page. He thought (and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree) that the background colour between the different content rectangles was too &amp;ldquo;white.&amp;rdquo;  I&amp;rsquo;ve changed it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the result either.  As of today it&amp;rsquo;s #eff8d1.   Any takers for a better background colour?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A corridor discussion with Allen Hazen this morning about permission statements, prompted by the well-known observation that when we say &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; we really mean &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and you can do &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, led me to show that (under certain assumptions) there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a two-place connective (call it &amp;lsquo;erk&amp;rsquo;) such that &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; erk &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is equivalent to &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and you can do &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s just that &amp;ldquo;erk&amp;rdquo; is not disjunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m in two minds as to what to do.  I want to write this up for public consumption, and this is a nice place to do it.  But I also think that setting that topic as an assignment question for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161212/pub/&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Logic class&lt;/a&gt; would be most appropriate.  It would be simple to do both, except that I&amp;rsquo;m confident that some of my students in Non-Classical Logic read this site. (Hi guys!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what should I do?  Post here?  Set it as an assignment?  Both?  Neither?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Publishing a Book</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/18/publishing_a_book/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2004 21:33:24 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/18/publishing_a_book/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;
On and off, I&#39;ve been thinking about what I&#39;m going to do with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;next book&lt;/a&gt;.  I mean, I&#39;m planning to write the thing, and to see to it that it is published by a decent publisher.  So much is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for it to get the kind of institutional recognition that is necessary for people in a position like mine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, I&#39;m looking for something more than that.  I&#39;m looking for my book to be &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;.  Getting read is more difficult than getting published, given the avalanche of academic material published each year.  I&#39;m hoping for this book to be &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;, for it to be &lt;em&gt;assigned as a textbook&lt;/em&gt;, for it to &lt;em&gt;corrupt the minds of the youth&lt;/em&gt;, and for it to &lt;em&gt;shape the field for years to come&lt;/em&gt;.  (I may as well aim high.)  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have come to the conclusion that one very good way for me to do this is for me to give the book away for free: I plan to post the book chapters, as they&#39;re written, online here, to have them indexed by search engines, to get people like you linking to it on your website, glancing through it, giving me feedback, helping me to improve it, etc., and to link to it, making it appear higher in search rankings, and giving other people more ways to stumble onto it, etc.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, there are quite a few &lt;a href=&#34;http://craphound.net/down&#34;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://craphound.net/est&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in the publishing world already.  People give away electronic copies of their book, and despite this &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; people buy the physical thing published by the publisher.  After all, there&#39;s something useful in letting the experts print and bind a copy, instead of you dealing with all of that hassle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can this be done with &lt;em&gt;academic&lt;/em&gt; books?  It turns out that it&#39;s already been done here too.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/&#34;&gt;Allen Hatcher&lt;/a&gt;, the topologist at Cornell, has published his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algebraic Topology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; textbook with Cambridge University Press, and he still &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html&#34;&gt;offers the whole thing for a free download&lt;/a&gt; at his site. This is unbelievably smart, if Allen&#39;s aim (as I suspect it is) is to be &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; by readers.  Allen&#39;s distribution rights are more restrictive than some public distribution conditions: he, and Cambridge University Press, allow you to print a single copy of the book from the files for personal use, but not to photocopy multiple copies.  This is not exactly simple for them to enforce, but you can understand why they make this restriction.  The files distributed are completely unencumbered PDF files, which print just as nicely as the Cambridge University Press version of his book.  (This, in my view, is much better than the state of play with most e-books which are typographically very poor.  That&#39;s not too problematic for a novel, but it&#39;s impossible for a mathematical text which requires fine typographical control to get the mathematics both correct and legible.)  What is the end result?  Allen Hatcher is (at the time of writing) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=algebraic+topology&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&#34;&gt;Google hit number 4 on algebraic topology&lt;/a&gt;, his book is how I learn any algebraic topology I need to know, and the dead tree version for sale &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521795400/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has a much higher sales rank than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/041521534X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;my book on substructural logic&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I think I will head down this path with &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Next Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Do you have any advice for me?  Is it a silly idea or not? 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; library filtered on the word &amp;ldquo;wind&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messenger Wind&lt;/em&gt;: Bruce Cockburn (&lt;em&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Seen Everything&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Child Of The Wind&lt;/em&gt;: Bruce Cockburn (&lt;em&gt;Nothing But A Burning Light&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wind&lt;/em&gt;: Keith Jarrett (&lt;em&gt;Paris Concert&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Cool Wind Is Blowing&lt;/em&gt;: Kronos Quartet (&lt;em&gt;Released 1985-1995&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Envy The Wind&lt;/em&gt;: Lucinda Williams (&lt;em&gt;Essence&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting collection.  Bruce Cockburn is over-represented considering that he&amp;rsquo;s only 609.4MB out of 14.57GB, but perhaps he has a thing for the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Note added on March 17: In the original post I had  the albums of the two Bruce Cockburn songs around the wrong way.  Not that any of us noticed, or anything.]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are God&#39;s Hands Tied By Logic?</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/12/are_gods_hands_tied_by_logic/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2004 12:12:44 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/12/are_gods_hands_tied_by_logic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000102/index.html&#34;&gt;paper with this title&lt;/a&gt; at an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arsdisputandi.org/&#34;&gt;online journal&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The consequence for philosophy of religion is quite simple--that if God is an  agent, his hands must be bound by logic. To many, this might seem to be a conclusion which is so trivial as to be scarcely worth stating--apart from Descartes, and a few other exceptions, have not most philosophers of religion always held that God&#39;s omnipotence does not include the ability to do illogical things?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; this conclusion, but I do want to give it a bit of a shake.  It strikes me that there&#39;s a much more general point lurking around here somewhere, that it says little interesting about God (after all, we&#39;re &#34;bound by logic&#34; just as much as God is), and, maybe more surprisingly, it says little interesting about &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is this: how do we conclude that God&#39;s hands &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; tied by logic?  We conclude that it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;logically impossible&lt;/em&gt; for God to do something which is prohibited by &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt;.  God can&#39;t square a circle, or make a tautology untrue, or do anything else like that.  Why is this?  It&#39;s because it&#39;s logically necessary that if something is logically necessary, it&#39;s true.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, logical necessity (which I&#39;ll represent by &#39;&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&#39;) satisfies the following condition:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Lp&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; distinctively true of logical necessity.  Lots of other operators satisfy this condition too.  (1) It&#39;s quite plausible to think that it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; necessary that what&#39;s &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; necessary is true.   (2) When you think about it, it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true that what&#39;s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true is true. (3)  I have even convinced myself that &lt;em&gt;it would be nice that&lt;/em&gt; (if &lt;em&gt;it would be nice that p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)!  And there are more where they came from. (If you like possible worlds semantics, let the accessibility relation governing &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; satisfy the condition that if a world &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; is accessed by a world &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; accesses itself too. Then &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Lp&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; is always satisfied).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&#39;s the upshot?  For any modality &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; satisfying this condition, it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; necessary that what is &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; necessary is true.  That is, in particular it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;-necessary that God not do things that are &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;-impossible.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s the upshot of this conclusion?  Consider the case of a trivial modality like the temporal &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;. Even though God will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; for do something which doesn&#39;t at some time, that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s no broader sense of &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; for which it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that God to do something which doesn&#39;t actually happen.  Now consider physical possibility.  Even though it is &lt;em&gt;physically impossible&lt;/em&gt; for God to do something which breaks the laws of physics (whatever the actual laws might be, thinking of them as universally true regularities, not things with actual exceptions), there can still be a broader sense of possibility, according to which it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that the laws of physics be different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; issue is whether there&#39;s any reason to think that  the modality of &lt;em&gt;logical necessity&lt;/em&gt; is any different to the others, or whether we could consider yet &lt;em&gt;broader&lt;/em&gt; senses of possibility.  &lt;em&gt;That&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; the place to look for something distinctive about the nature of the grip of logical necessity.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching, teaching, teaching</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/11/teaching_teaching_teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2004 21:35:22 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/11/teaching_teaching_teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Teaching for 2004 Semester 1 is now well underway.  My classes for this term have been enjoyable in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Non-Classical Logic&lt;/em&gt; is a second/third level logic class.  I&#39;ve decided to follow Graham Priest&#39;s book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/052179434X/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt; rather closely, which means I don&#39;t need to make too many further decisions.  (It&#39;s designed to fit into an Australian academic semester, and to follow an intro logic course just like &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/&#34;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;.)  The book doesn&#39;t take &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the line I&#39;d follow, but it&#39;s much better than a merely &#34;good enough&#34; book that I&#39;d use through gritted teeth. My differences with Graham&#39;s view of things are two.  &lt;ol&gt; 
&lt;li style=&#34;margin-top:5px;&#34;&gt; Graham structures the course around the search for a good semantics for the conditional of natural language.  I think that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; question is both easier (for many purposes -- think of mathematical reasoning -- the &#34;material conditional&#34; is just fine and dandy, thankyou very much) and more difficult (there&#39;s all sorts of context sensitivity in conditional constructions which a sensible look at would take you very very far away from a second-level undergraduate course) than Graham concedes, so I don&#39;t get as much out of the central theme as Graham does.&lt;/li&gt;   
&lt;li&gt; I think that there is more mileage you can get out of the idea of a &lt;em&gt;normal modal logic&lt;/em&gt; than Graham manages to express in his Chapter 3.  The ideas of modal logic are just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; fruitful and &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; beautiful, that I can&#39;t speed over them in just one chapter.  Think &lt;em&gt;temporal&lt;/em&gt; logic, &lt;em&gt;deontic&lt;/em&gt; logic, &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; logic,  etc., etc&amp;nbsp;...  Here, the formal stuff is just so beautiful that I need to do more than Graham does with this material.  This is, as far as I can tell, a matter of &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt;, and this is one place that my taste differs from Graham&#39;s, and it shows.  There is more to be said for the role of the teacher as a cultivator of taste, but I must leave that for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Teaching this class is enjoyable because I know the material like the back of my hand, the students are (mostly) keen to learn, and it&#39;s a healthy mix of teaching different kinds of constructions, proving theorems, and doing philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; My &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; major responsibility is my fourth-year honours seminar entitled &lt;em&gt;Logic &amp;amp; Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;.  This year we&#39;re going through some of Robert Brandom&#39;s greatest hits, starting with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674001583/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Articulating Reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, glancing aside to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674543300/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making it Explicit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where necessary (the running joke is that &lt;em&gt;Articulating Reasons&lt;/em&gt; should be subtitled &#34;Making &lt;em&gt;Making it Explicit&lt;/em&gt; Explicit&#34;) and then on to some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674009037/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tales of the Mighty Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a &#34;big picture&#34; philosophy course, taking in history, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, normative theory, philosophy of logic, and the kitchen sink.  I&#39;m uneasy with anticipation when I wonder what the students (and here I have a smaller group of about twelve) will make of it all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; teaching responsibilities, I have a small honours reading course in modal logic that I&#39;m taking with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#allen&#34;&gt;Allen Hazen&lt;/a&gt;, a new honours student to supervise, a couple of continuing Ph.D. students, and two and a half &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; Ph.D. students, all working on interesting projects.  I have to keep up with inferentialism and Kant&#39;s theory of judgement, non-standard probability theory, ontology, Carnap &amp;amp; van Fraassen &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;stances&lt;/em&gt;, and the distinction between pure and depraved &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;.  This, in case you were wondering, is why I&#39;m sometimes just a little behind on other things.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reboot</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/08/reboot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2004 20:05:54 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2004/03/08/reboot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;
This site has been sitting fallow for eleven months.  That&#39;s far too long in short-attention web land, so no doubt I&#39;ve lost my vast readership.  It&#39;s time to reboot it, so here we go.  There are a few changes that have been on my mind for some time.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;. Tired of white, tired of websafe colours, I&#39;ve gone to earth tones for a change.  Sterility be gone!  I&#39;ve only checked in a couple of different browsers, so let me know if there are any bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I&#39;ve succumbed to weblog-ism just a little.  I&#39;ve swapped the news section with one of the sidebars, mainly so that I can post more photos in the &#34;News&#34; section of the site without the restriction to a 250 pixel width in the right column.  Now I have more options, and I might just post more pictures here.  It should also give me room to post more &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt; here, like all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/tar/&#34;&gt;cool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umsu.de/wo/index.php&#34;&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt; are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I&#39;ve upgraded to the latest version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://movabletype.org&#34;&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt; to run this thing.  I&#39;ve also decided to turn on comments on the &lt;em&gt;News&lt;/em&gt; section of the site and one other part&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ...&amp;nbsp;which is the &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; change around here.  I&#39;ve recoded the publications section of the site: &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;consequently.org/writing&lt;/a&gt; is now your one-stop-repository for everything academic of mine to hit print.  This used to be a pain to code by hand, and when I caught wind of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/07/16/rebuilding_a_portfolio.html&#34;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; out there of people using weblog software to power a portfolio site, I thought that it might work for my publications page.  It&#39;s pretty neat the way it works from my side.  Every article/draft/book is a &#34;blog entry&#34; of its own, with a title, publication or draft date, abstract, pointer to a &lt;abbr title=&#34;Portable Document Format&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt; file of the paper (if it exists), and its own &lt;em&gt;comment area&lt;/em&gt;.  That means readers like you can comment on anything I&#39;ve written in the one place where other web browsing readers are likely to find it.  Not that you&#39;d necessarily want to comment on what I&#39;ve written, but I like feedback, and maybe &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of you will feel moved to comment.  I&#39;ll be interested to see what it means when it comes to paper drafts, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;Next Book Project&lt;/a&gt;, for which I plan to post draft chapters as they&#39;re written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, sit back, relax, leave a comment, download some &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;, subscribe to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/index.xml&#34;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/snippets/index.xml&#34;&gt;feeds&lt;/a&gt;, and wait for the next update!

      <title>Learning Negation</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Having a young child gives you lots of new examples about language learning and concept acquisition.  (It also provides you with many opportunities for experimentation, but I will set that to one side, for the moment.)  Here is one such example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, I was changing Z&amp;rsquo;s nappy and getting him dressed.  He was in a happy mood, and I asked him if he would like me to tickle him.  He said &lt;em&gt;no, no tickle&lt;/em&gt;.  Not to be deterred, I asked him again, and he responded again in kind.  There is no doubt that children learn to &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;refuse&lt;/em&gt; very early in their development.  Children also learn &lt;em&gt;opposites&lt;/em&gt; quite quickly too.  Z has mastered vary many pairs of opposites, and he knows how to use them to his own advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Z again, rephrasing the question: &lt;em&gt;would you like a &lt;strong&gt;little&lt;/strong&gt; tickle?&lt;/em&gt;  Z knew that he wanted to deny this, and so he went for what he took to be the relevant opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, no, no! &lt;strong&gt;Big&lt;/strong&gt; tickle!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the tickling that followed, another lesson was learned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clouds of War</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have refrained from making any public comment about the coming war with Iraq that Australia is about to enter.  Partly out of general reticence, partly because the whole matter is very depressing, and partly because my own thoughts and feelings are inarticulate.  However, one way to deal with inarticulate thoughts and feelings is to attempt to articulate them, so here I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with most people, I agree that the Hussein regime is terrible and Iraq would be better off without him.  Along with most people, I agree that a full-scale invasion, with cruise missiles, bombs, tanks, infantry, chemical and biological weapons and the consequent death, carnage and destruction is a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; outcome.  But none of this is what depresses me most.  What depresses me most is &lt;em&gt;what could have been&lt;/em&gt; and how much more sane what could have been compares with what is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had things gone differently, we would have had stronger international institutions.  Instead of the blunt instrument of war and occupation, with all of the historical connotation of western invasions in the region, we would be able to deal with this regime differently. Not just the UN Security Council: that&amp;rsquo;s clearly a blunt instrument too.  What we need is an operative, experienced and powerful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iccnow.org/&#34;&gt;international criminal court&lt;/a&gt; and an international criminal justice system. If we had this, Saddam Hussein and his regime could be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.  If we had a robust international judicial system, we would be able to &lt;em&gt;prosecute&lt;/em&gt; criminals and treat them with justice in a way that is also &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; to be just.  The only convincing reasons I have heard for the invasion and occupation of Iraq are actually better reasons for a &lt;em&gt;police action&lt;/em&gt; to detain a criminal and to bring him to justice.  If only we had the institutions and practices in place to make this possible.  Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iccnow.org/html/cassel19990512.html&#34;&gt;neither Iraq nor United States&lt;/a&gt; signed up for the International Criminal Court (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/19/1023864456953.html&#34;&gt;Australia kicked up a bit of a fuss about it&lt;/a&gt;, before eventually signing up) so it appears that they would rather have the bloodshed and confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>“Tantrum”</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2003/03/12/tantrum/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/zacharyhelping.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;280&#34; alt=&#34;Zachary at work in the Kitchen&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zachary helping Christine in the Kitchen.  March 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary had a difficult day today, missing his afternoon sleep, and getting a bit cranky as a result.  This evening, as I was cooking dinner for Christine and myself, and supervising Zachary eating his dinner, he decided he&amp;rsquo;d had enough of his meal (i.e., he had fingered it a bit, no more), which he had specifically requested (chicken + vegetable rissole and toast, please), and would much prefer grapes.  The scene continued something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Grapes.  Grapes.  More grapes.&amp;rdquo;  Approaches the refrigerator and opens the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;No grapes, Zachary, until you&amp;rsquo;ve had some more of your dinner.  You asked for the chicken, and I think you should eat some more.&amp;rdquo;  Gently shuts the fridge door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;No chicken.  Grapes.&amp;rdquo;  Opens fridge door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;No grapes yet, Zachary.  Not until you have had some more chicken.  You asked for the chicken, and I made it for you.&amp;rdquo; (Speaking not quite truthfully, as I had simply reheated the rissole, and toasted and buttered the toast.  Zachary and Christine had done the lions share of making the rissoles a couple of days before.)  Shuts fridge door again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: Falls face down on floor (classic tantrum position), and says in a clear, calm voice, &amp;ldquo;Tantrum.  Tantrum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy&lt;/em&gt;: Quizzically. &amp;ldquo;Are you having a tantrum?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: Calmly.  &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;  Gets up by himself and returns to his dinner to eat some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he understands his own emotional state this well by the time he is in his teenage years, I should be a very happy father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new picture.  This picture was taken last December on the infamous &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/archives/000107.html&#34;&gt;Williamstown Ferry trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes start next week, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to them, even though preparation has been a bit tight.  I am especially interested to see how my &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161438/pub/&#34;&gt;fourth year honours class&lt;/a&gt; enjoy what I have in store for them.  Hopefully by the time I am done, the students will know a whole lot more, and I will have written the literature review for my next book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zachary with spots. February 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary&amp;rsquo;s chicken-pox spots are fading now, so he is probably past the most infectious stage.  This photo is from the first seriously full-on day of spots, last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February Pictures</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;February pictures of Zachary are &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  They were taken on our day trip to the Dandenongs with Uncle Martin.  Zachary was &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image3.html&#34;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image5.html&#34;&gt;keen&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image6.html&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image8.html&#34;&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for him, and for us, Zack&amp;rsquo;s come down with chicken-pox.  The photos are all pre-pox, so there are no pictures of spots.  Or of &lt;em&gt;fots&lt;/em&gt; as he calls them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2003/02/18/thoughts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2003 11:59:37 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2003/02/18/thoughts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like there are too many thoughts to think and too little time in which to think them.  Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: I really ought to think of a detailed response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophyweblog.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_philosophyweblog_archive.html#89228851&#34;&gt;Brian Weatherson&amp;rsquo;s comments&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/envelopes.pdf&#34;&gt;my two envelopes paper co-authored with Graham&lt;/a&gt;, but that detailed response will have to wait a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, let me write a little enigmatic response while it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an ambiguity in asking whether one &amp;lsquo;ought to switch&amp;rsquo; or not.  One answer will depend on which action maximises expected utility, given the process which places money in each envelope.  Another will depend on which action maximises expected utility, given what I know about the process placing money in each envelope.  If the circumstance is as Brian describes (I have envelope A, and the process has resulted $n in A and either $(0.5)n or $2n in envelope B with equal likelihood), then switching will maximise utility expected in sense 2.  If I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether I have envelope A or envelope B, and I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know that I have equal probability of having envelope A or having envelope B (and the rest of the process is as Brian describes), then we are indifferent between switching and keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems right to me, but I can&amp;rsquo;t confirm if that&amp;rsquo;s the view of the &lt;em&gt;authors of the paper&lt;/em&gt;, as we haven&amp;rsquo;t met to talk about this one yet.  Graham &lt;a href=&#34;http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/papers.php3&#34;&gt;presented the paper at the ANU&lt;/a&gt; (the subtitle &lt;em&gt;the definitive solution to the two-envelope paradox&lt;/em&gt; was not my idea!) and we have some other comments to work through, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have other pressing business also in the queue, including the final touches on a grant application, referee&amp;rsquo;s reports, overdue book reviews, a too big pile of email to read and preparation for upcoming lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butterfly, at the Zoo, December 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the 2003 redesign for the site.  It&amp;rsquo;s late, if you count calendar years, but it&amp;rsquo;s early, if you count our teaching year.  Classes don&amp;rsquo;t start for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design includes the &amp;lsquo;Snippets&amp;rsquo; section, which will include links I find in day-to-day browsing.  This &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; section will contain photos and longer items of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;John Baez&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html&#34;&gt;Crackpot Index&lt;/a&gt; seems to me to be a pretty good measure of the difficult to define phenomenon of crackpottedness.  Notice the relatively low cost of outright &lt;em&gt;inconsistency&lt;/em&gt; compared to nearly everything else.  That warms my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics is just plain &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand it at all, partly because of the strange nature of the &lt;em&gt;probabilities&lt;/em&gt; in QM.  They certainly seem to fit observation (so physicists say), but what do they &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?  Well, &lt;em&gt;it just might be&lt;/em&gt; that they are traditional probabilities after all.  That is, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phys.uu.nl/~thooft/&#34;&gt;Gerard &amp;rsquo;t Hooft&lt;/a&gt; has proposed a new deterministic interpretation of QM which makes sense of all of the numbers.  &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nsu/030106/030106-6.html&#34;&gt;elementary article&lt;/a&gt; about it, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/quant-ph/0212095&#34;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; is available for the hard-core physicists among you.  It looks neat from here, but as I have said, I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the details.  Those of you who do, let me know: does this account avoid the &lt;a href=&#34;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/HiddenVariables.html&#34;&gt;usual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/#hv&#34;&gt;objections&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;ldquo;hidden variables&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brett Lee in Action</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/Lee_In_Action.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; alt=&#34;Brett Lee in Action at the MCG...&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett Lee in delivery stride at the MCG today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was spent at the MCG, on the second day of the Boxing Day Test.  My brother, my nephew and I spent a delightful day soaking up the atmosphere, enjoying some fine batting (especially Justin Langer and Martin Love) and some fine bowling (each of McGrath, Gillespie, MacGill and Lee were in dangerous form).  The fact that all of the good performances were from the one team meant that the competition was not as balanced as you would like, but you can&amp;rsquo;t ask for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the cricket live is a very different activity to simply watching it on TV or listening to the radio.  It&amp;rsquo;s more of an &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt; for one thing.  You get to choose what you&amp;rsquo;ll focus your attention on, and, in some ways, there is much &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; information available to you than when watching it on the box &amp;ndash; despite the manifold graphs and charts and tables you find on the TV.  In the crowd you hear the reactions of the rest of the crowd.  You feel just how &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; the bowling is (at least, Brett Lee at 150km/h) and how &lt;em&gt;skilled&lt;/em&gt; the reactions of the batsmen are.  We were watching from roughly side-on in the Olympic Stand (at around 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock on the dial) and you get a very good impression of just how far back the wicketkeeper stands when facing a fast bowler.  It was fun.  I&amp;rsquo;ll do that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I just found a very insightful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=3949&#34;&gt;interview with Philip Pullman&lt;/a&gt;, the author of the &lt;em&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/em&gt; trilogy.  I haven&#39;t read the trilogy yet, but I probably will before I get to Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk&#34;&gt;Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, the mob who published the interview, produce some of the best (Christian) theologically informed social comment around.  Sadly, that&#39;s not saying very much, given the quality of most Christian writing, but Third Way is still very good.  Their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; is worth a browse.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;em&gt;Third Way&lt;/em&gt; predates New Labour, the rise of Tony Blair and the articulation of &#34;Third Way&#34; Politics &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lse.ac.uk/Giddens/FAQs.htm#Third%20way%20politics&#34;&gt;by Anthony Giddens&lt;/a&gt; by many years.  The magazine was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk/in/history.asp&#34;&gt;launched in 1977&lt;/a&gt;, significantly predating the reformation of the British Labour Party.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have to let you know that I really don&#39;t enjoy marking first year logic exams.  I love teaching the subject, but the marking is just a hard slog.  And it&#39;s depressing in the cases of failures.  The bright spots are the cases of really excellent work.  But the tedium is pretty tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;More &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308573168.html&#34;&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt; to be thankful that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au&#34;&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt; publishes Peter Roebuck&amp;rsquo;s commentary on the cricket too.  It makes breakfast newspaper reading enjoyable.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308573168.html&#34;&gt;Here is one example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lehmann will be popular with spectators because he is an antidote to the prevailing fashion, a throwback to the days of blue-collar cricketers. As far as this column knows, he spends his evenings reading long-winded novels, eating carrots and sipping fizzy water but he does manage to create the impression of a man with a more colourful range of recreational interests.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More&amp;rsquo;s the pity that the cricket itself may not be able to sustain so much interest, with  contest &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/news/sport/cricket/2002/11/item20021110211921_1.htm&#34;&gt;so uneven&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m glad that my tickets for the MCG test are for the second day, and not the fourth or fifth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zoo.org.au/visiting.cfm?zoo_id=1&#34;&gt;Zoo&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday afternoon.  It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; busy, dodging all of the other prams and strollers.  The zoo is only a couple of minutes (drive) away from our place: it&amp;rsquo;s halfway between our house and the university.  So, we&amp;rsquo;ve become &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zoo.org.au/FOTZ/&#34;&gt;Friends of the Zoo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s great to visit during the week, when it&amp;rsquo;s much quieter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Settling In</title>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2002/09/01/settling_in/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the lack of updates lately.  We&#39;ve been slowly settling in to Melbourne.  Zack loves his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/childcare/centres/qbcontact.html&#34;&gt;childcare&lt;/a&gt;, but settling in has meant a range of new infections in quick succession.  (Conjunctivitis, a severe ear infection and gastroenteritis.)  The latter, he managed to give to me, and this has meant that I now have new insight into the etymology of the term &amp;ldquo;wretched.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, here are a few highlights of recent weeks. First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/&#34;&gt;my logic students&lt;/a&gt; (they&#39;re bright and enthusiastic), the logic seminars we&#39;ve run each Friday for the last few weeks (it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; to be in a place where we have the critical mass to sustain a regular seminar), the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bellshakespeare.com.au/&#34;&gt;Bell Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt; production of &lt;em&gt;The Comedy of Errors&lt;/em&gt; (in the pre-play warmup when the magician &lt;em&gt;Pinch&lt;/em&gt; was doing a range of tricks, he used my jacket for one---the ubiquitous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll make you think I&amp;rsquo;ve put this knife through your nice jacket&amp;rdquo; trick), and today&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Father&#39;s Day&lt;/em&gt; extravaganza, featuring nice presents (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/05/06/1019441476677.html&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sidsaustralia.org.au/mos/vic/melbforkids/melbkids2.htm&#34;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864367350/&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;) and a wonderful breakfast, and a Zachary who slept in until 7:30am!  Things are &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is seriously elegant: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/08/science/08MATH.html&#34;&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt;, three Indian mathematicians have shown that you can test primality (deterministically) in polynomial time.  That&#39;s incredible.  More incredible, I seem to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/news/primality.html&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Moving house is tiring.  Moving house with a young child is exciting, but very tiring.  Moving house to a new city, and rewiring your brain to cope with the changes in weather, shopping, driving, childcare, work, and the innumerable other habits which need to be unlearned and relearned, is very very tiring.  Moving house and waiting five days for your personal effects to catch up with you is not so much &lt;em&gt;tiring&lt;/em&gt; as extremely frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we&#39;re here in Melbourne, we&#39;re happy, and we&#39;re settling in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a sweet three bedroom cottage, with a little backyard and front garden.  Room enough for visitors, so come and visit sometime.  We move in when we arrive in Melbourne: in around two week&#39;s time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2002/06/05/househunting_by_remote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m spending most of my time and emotional energy finding a place to live in Melbourne.  It&#39;s now &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to do a fair bit of this at a distance, due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realestate.com.au/&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; listing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realestateview.com.au/&#34;&gt;available properties&lt;/a&gt;, but of course you have to be there to inspect properties.  Timing, as usual, is &lt;em&gt;almost everything&lt;/em&gt;.  In this business &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; is also almost everything.  It follows that timing overlaps a great deal with money&amp;mdash;which has been noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m flying down to Melbourne this weekend to take a personal look at a few rental properties, and hopefully to place a bond on a suitable one.  Given that we move in 3 weeks&#39; time, I&#39;ll be spending less time online until we&#39;re up and settled in our new home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A helpful summary &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i39/39a01601.htm&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com&#34;&gt;Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on the proliferation of biographies of philosophers.  The central question is whether biography of philosophers illuminates the philosophy itself.  Lots of people say there&#39;s nothing one can say about there other.  Others say that all philosophy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; biography.  Here&#39;s one case where I steer a middle path.  I&#39;m beginning to see the value of philosophical biography, as a part of a larger enterprise: the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; of philosophy.  History of philosophy is beginning a resurgance, and with good reason.  Often by looking back to see the context in which an idea/concept/argument/trope was introduced, you see more clearly how it operates and how it is currently used.  Philosophical &lt;em&gt;biography&lt;/em&gt; is an important component of the history of philosophy itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just been invited to give a lecture at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uniovi.es/Congresos/2003/DLMPS/&#34;&gt;12th International Congress of Logic Methodology and Philosophy of Science&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Oveido&lt;/a&gt;, in August, 2003.  This is Very Nice.  The first really &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; international conference I ever attended  to was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uniovi.es/Congresos/2003/DLMPS/Earlier/Welcome.htm&#34;&gt;10th LMPS Congress in Florence&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 (I was a postdoc then), and I had a truly wonderful time.  I gave an early version of my &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/publications.html#negrl&#34;&gt;Negation in Relevant Logic&lt;/a&gt;&#34; as a &#34;contributed paper&#34;.  It&#39;s a great honour to be one of the invited lecturers (not least because invited lectures get a slot of around an hour, and contributed ones go for around 15 minutes!) and I&#39;m delighted to get the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About The Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.consequently.org/news/2002/05/13/about_the_internet/</link>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2002/05/13/about_the_internet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;... the Internet radically redefines a person&#39;s psychological relationship to time and space. Attention is rivetted on what is tangible, useful, instantly available; the stimulus for deeper thought and reflection may be lacking. Yet human beings have a vital need for time and inner quiet to ponder and examine life and its mysteries, and to grow gradually into a mature dominion of themselves and of the world around them. [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/communications/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_20020122_world-communications-day_en.html&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was from the &lt;em&gt;Pope&lt;/em&gt;, in a message urging the Church to get into the internet (but to also beware of its limitations).  David Weinberger has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85081552&#34;&gt;interesting response&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the difference between seeing &lt;em&gt;proclaiming a message&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;engaging in conversation&lt;/em&gt;.  The Holy Father seems keen on the former, without showing much enthusiasm for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;stamp&#34;&gt;What is it with the &#34;parchment&#34; background image on Papal pages on the net?  It looks kitsch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The current ASIO bill before federal parliament is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/02/1019441397890.html&#34;&gt;very big worry&lt;/a&gt;.  No-one should be allowed to arbitrarily detain people on suspicion of &lt;em&gt;having contact with&lt;/em&gt; a member of an what has simply been designated by the Attorney General as a terrorist organisation.  As an academic who regularly comes into contact with hundreds of students on a daily basis, it follows that I could be detained at the whim of the security organisation, if this bill were to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do ASIO want such powers? Or rather, why do the current government want to give these powers to them?  The proximate explanation for this power is so that people in contact with &#34;suspected terrorists&#34; may be detained so as to not inform them of a possible attempt at arrest.  Clearly such draconian and undemocratic powers aren&#39;t necessary for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; outcome. This ought to make us worry about what the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; reason might be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t normally spend my time worrying about the monopolistic practices of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;that software company&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25085.html&#34;&gt;this case&lt;/a&gt; is too bizarre to go unremarked.  In a nutshell, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/education/?id=DonatedComputers&#34;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft explain that if a computer is donated to a school, it&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;legal requirement&lt;/em&gt; that the original software installed on the computer be donated with it.  Notice that they agree that the school can &lt;em&gt;upgrade&lt;/em&gt; the software on the computer to another version of Windows.  Why, then, should the school not accept computers which have been previously upgraded with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freebsd.org/&#34;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux.org&#34;&gt;operating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/&#34;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;?  When is an upgrade allowed, and when is it not?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/crossroads/pubs.htm&#34;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; rumblings about higher education and its funding here in Australia.  Everyone agrees that universities are underfunded, but there is not a whole lot of agreement about what to do about it.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/crossroads/pubs.htm&#34;&gt;recent discussion paper&lt;/a&gt;, flagging increased deregulation for public universities, has sparked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s541198.htm&#34;&gt;some debate&lt;/a&gt;.  I notice a change in my own reaction to these things, as I move from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;middle-ranking university&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;one set to benefit from any deregulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Banned from the casinos, Blaise rolled up huge debts with illegal existentialists, who set arbitrary odds and paid off arguments on a whim. After losing three times in a week to the idea that all of human consciousness is the precocious hallucination of a disembodied llama brain in a mad sorcerer&#39;s laboratory, Blaise began to despair, and I knew I had to help him.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&#34;The text is wonderfully clear and avoids the tedium of many introductory logic texts. The examples, exercises, and suggestions for further reading are all good. This is the only introductory text I know of that introduces students to some of the philosophical problems logic pertains to and intersects with. It is the type of book I would like to use for an introductory course and recommend it enthusiastically.&#34;  &amp;mdash;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=860&#34;&gt;Michael Hallett, Philosophy Department, McGill University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div class=&#34;oldcons&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;21&#34;&gt;2002/03/21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to be the 10th search result on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.altavista.com/&#34;&gt;AltaVista&lt;/a&gt; for &#34;unthinking unmanned criticized submarine teletype.&#34;  What on &lt;em&gt;earth&lt;/em&gt; could this mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;20&#34;&gt;2002/03/20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who wrote &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Theories of new types of inference, ignored or misunderstood by the traditional logic, have at the same time been discovered and worked out with true mathematical elegance.  No one can debar mathematicians from staking claims to all that can be treated in terms of mathematical form and method.  Only if one is ignorant of the modern science of mathematics, particularly of formal mathematics, and measures it by the standards of Euclid or Adam Riese, can one remain stuck in the common prejudice that the essence of mathematics lies in number and quantity.  It is not the mathematician, but the philosopher, who oversteps his legitimate sphere when he attacks the `mathematicizing&#39; theories of logic, and refuses to hand over his temporary foster-children to their natural parents.  The scorn with which philosophical logicians like to speak of mathematical theories of inference, does not alter the fact that the mathematical form of treatment is in their case (as in the case of all strictly developed theories in the proper sense of this word) the only scientific one, the only one that offers us systematic closure and completeness, and a survey of all possible questions together with the possible forms of their answers.
&lt;p&gt;
If the development of all true theories falls in the mathematician&#39;s field, what is left over for philosophers?  Here we must note that the mathematician is not really the pure theoretician, but only the ingenious technician, the constructor, as it were, who, looking merely to formal interconnections, builds up his theory like a technical work of art.  As the practical mechanic constructs machines, without ultimate insight into the essence of nature and its laws, so the mathematician constructs theories of numbers, quantities, syllogisms, manifolds, without ultimate insight into the essence of theory in general, and that of the concepts and laws which are its conditions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Inspired hunches, informed guesses, or definite answers are invited at &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/discuss/messages.cgi/showThread?id=6&#34;&gt;discussion group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;19&#34;&gt;2002/03/19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/&#34;&gt;Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i25/25b01401.htm&#34;&gt;Letters of Recommendation&lt;/a&gt; -- a purely academic form of writing with conventions like no other.  It&#39;s especially difficult here, where we have to deal with &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt; letters of recommendation with their hyperbole along with much more understated &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; letters. References from Australians probably fall somewhere in between these two. A couple of my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www,phil.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; will have to read a number of these quite soon, in the quest to find my replacement in the department.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;18&#34;&gt;2002/03/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-03-18.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s been a long hiatus, hasn&#39;t it?
&lt;p&gt;
Life&#39;s been extremely busy, and I&#39;ve been enjoying &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/ZackAtManly.jpg&#34;&gt;doing other things&lt;/a&gt;: almost everything other than posting on this website.  I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; get back into the swing of posting things here sometime, however.  No promises yet, though.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>News from February 2002</title>

      <guid>https://www.consequently.org/news/2002/2002_02/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div class=&#34;oldcons&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;27&#34;&gt;2002/02/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A two week absence from this site is pretty large, at least when its unannounced.  As you can probably tell, I&#39;m snowed under.  Slowly digging through that inbox and the pile of administrative work which requires doing.  You might even get a link recommendation or two from me in the next few days.  But I&#39;m not promising anything.  First, I must get back to that email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;13&#34;&gt;2002/02/13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/discuss/&#34;&gt;discussion group&lt;/a&gt; has formed a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/discuss/messages.cgi/showThread?id=4&#34;&gt;life of its own&lt;/a&gt;.  Here, as elsewhere, the action is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html&#34;&gt;below the surface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;07&#34;&gt;2002/02/07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a lot about the structure of the universe (well, at least the 
relationship between wishes and choices) can be inferred from folk wisdom.  Here is an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.okay.com/dunc/wishes.htm&#34;&gt;If wishes were horses,&lt;br/&gt;
beggars would ride&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
So, if wishes were &lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
beggars would be choosers.&lt;p&gt;
But &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sects.demon.co.uk/lyrics/beglyrics.htm&#34;&gt;beggars can&#39;t be choosers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Therefore, wishes can&#39;t be choices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;02&#34;&gt;2002/02/02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~reeken/dvi/jor.dvi&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is something I really love.  (Warning, it&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;dvi&lt;/em&gt; file.  If you don&#39;t know what a dvi file is, it&#39;s almost certain that you won&#39;t have the software to deal with it.  Sorry.)  Anyway, this paper &#34;A nonstandard proof of the Jordan curve theorem&#34; by Vladimir Kanovei and Michael Reeken, is a beautiful piece of mathematics.  The Jordan Curve theorem is a particularly easy theorem to state, and a particularly hard theorem to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; with the kind of rigour mathematicians desire and enjoy.  Here&#39;s the theorem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every closed curve in the plane divides the plane into two regions, the inside and the outside.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That&#39;s pretty darn obvious, you might think, but it&#39;s not obvious when you realise that closed curves can be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; complicated.  (Curves of high fractal dimensions, for an example.)  Anyway, the paper by Kanovei and Reeken shows that it&#39;s pretty easy to prove if you move from the standard &#34;real&#34; plane to consider it embedded in the &#34;nonstandard&#34; plane of nonstandard coordinates (think &lt;em&gt;infinitesimals&lt;/em&gt;).  Anyway, considered as a curve in the nonstandard plane, a curve is actually a polygon with infinitely many (very short) straight &#34;sides&#34;.  But for polygons, it&#39;s easy to tell whether a point is on the inside or the outside.  Start with a point arbitrarily far away from the curve (which we&#39;ll call &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt;), and then draw a line to the point you want to consider.  Just count the number of times you cross the &lt;em&gt;polygon&lt;/em&gt; along the straight line to the target point.  Even number of crossings?  You&#39;re &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt;.  Odd number of crossings?  You&#39;re &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt;.  
&lt;p&gt;
The remaining trick is to deal with the case in where the number of crossings is &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;.  In this case, Kanovei and Reeken show that a sensible notion of &#34;even&#34; and &#34;odd&#34; can be defined for the kind of infinities applied here, and the result still applies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s a lovely piece of work.  It&#39;s the kind of thing that I find so enjoyable in mathematics.  It&#39;s sometimes easier to solve a problem by initially making it &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; complicated.  The seemingly harder theorem is sometimes simpler to prove, because in the new space, different rules apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;2002/02/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.keating.org.au/&#34;&gt;immediate past prime minister&lt;/a&gt; and the current incumbent are two very different people.  There&#39;s no way, for example, that the current model would ever call anyone &#34;pre-Copernican obscurantists.&#34;  That was Keating on the current government, on the &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;debate on cross media ownership rules&lt;/a&gt;.  For more Keating-isms, try the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webcity.com.au/keating/&#34;&gt;Paul Keating Insults Archive&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
For something a little more uplifting than that, try Keating&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://apology.west.net.au/redfern.html&#34;&gt;1992 speech at Redfern&lt;/a&gt;.  It ends:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We cannot imagine that the descendants of people whose genius and resilience maintained a culture here through 50 000 years or more, through cataclysmic changes to the climate and environment, and who then survived two centuries of dispossession and abuse, will be denied their place in the modern Australian nation. 
&lt;p&gt;
We cannot imagine that. 
&lt;p&gt;
We cannot imagine that we will fail. 
&lt;p&gt;
And with the spirit that is here today I am confident that we won&#39;t. 
&lt;p&gt;
I am confident that we will succeed in this decade. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That speech was given in December 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Scarratt sent me a link to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://selectsmart.com/PHILOSOPHY/&#34;&gt;Ethical
Philosophy Selector&lt;/a&gt;.  Find out which philosopher you best match, when it comes to ethics.  I managed to match &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/augustine.html&#34;&gt;Augustine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which struck me as not-quite-right, but then I don&#39;t think I match too many other people on the list anyway.   &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/discuss/messages.cgi/showThread?id=3&#34;&gt;Who do you match?&lt;/a&gt;

Zachary and I enjoyed a swimming lesson at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mycommunity.com.au/leichhardt/council/council/services/aquatic.html&#34;&gt;Leichhardt Pool&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.  Very exciting, and lots of fun.  He was the oldest baby there, and the month or two he had on the other babies really made a difference.  He was completely unfazed and relaxed in the water.  (It might have been the previous times we&#39;ve been swimming together, too, I suppose.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;30&#34;&gt;2002/01/30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m glad that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/index.asp&#34;&gt;RateMyProfessors.com&lt;/a&gt; has not made it to Australia.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m also glad that you can&#39;t seem to browse the archive by discipline.  It&#39;s just too prurient to browse a list of philosophers to see who&#39;s popular and who&#39;s not, among undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;29&#34;&gt;2002/01/29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are back.  They&#39;re different, and hopefully better.  Visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/discuss&#34;&gt;consequently.org/discuss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;28&#34;&gt;2002/01/28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m preparing for my move to Melbourne.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Christine gave me the great &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/&#34;&gt;Lonely Planet&lt;/a&gt; guide to &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/product_detail.cfm?productID=43&#34;&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, for my birthday, and I&#39;ve been planning enough little and big excursions to keep us occupied for the next few years.  Victoria may be small, but there&#39;s lot&#39;s of different stuff there.
&lt;li&gt; The database of real estate ads at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/&#34;&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt; is emailing me a list likely rental properties in my Favoured Spots, weekly.  I have no idea how we&#39;re going to actually &lt;em&gt;arrange&lt;/em&gt; renting a property at this distance (I can&#39;t exactly pop down to Melbourne at the drop of a hat, can I?) but I&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
&lt;li&gt; I&#39;ve also been checking out public transport.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.victrip.com.au/&#34;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; is a usability disaster, and the pages of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.swanstontrams.com.au/&#34;&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yarratrams.com.au/&#34;&gt;corporations&lt;/a&gt; are no better.  However, there&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ptua/&#34;&gt;significant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alphalink.com.au/~parkerp/melsuba.htm&#34;&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.custard.net.au/melbtrans/&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; keen to provide information about public transport and advocate its cause to the community and government.  I like that a lot.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;27&#34;&gt;2002/01/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting observation emailed to me from David Scarratt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I saw from the train on the way to work yesterday a billboard with an
ad for Logicin: &#34;Logical relief from coughs and colds&#34;.  Perhaps
they&#39;re offering formal systems that alleviate nasal congestion, etc.
The Old English reading group at work came up with a couple of rules
for such a system: a conjunctivitis elimination rule, and the law of
the excluded middle ear.  We also wondered whether disjunctivitis
would be inflammation of the disjuncts.  I can see a whole new field
of medical (remedial?) logic opening up; satisfaction would no doubt
figure prominently.  I&#39;d hate to think what would happen to someone
who contracted a contradiction...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What surprises me is that they have an Old English reading group at his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ot.com.au/&#34;&gt;workplace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;26&#34;&gt;2002/01/26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s freaky seeing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/041521534X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;inside of your book on Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;.  I mean, someone took the time to scan the pages you can read the preview?  That&#39;s amazing.  Anyway, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/041521534X/&#34;&gt;go buy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl&#34;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;, please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;25&#34;&gt;2002/01/25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-25.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with logic is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.syntheticzero.com/jan2002.php#January22_2002&#34;&gt;not that it&#39;s too simple&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s that it has bad press, and as a result, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.syntheticzero.com/jan2002.php#January22_2002&#34;&gt;people think it&#39;s too simple&lt;/a&gt;.  After all, only bad press could explain a critique like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.syntheticzero.com/jan2002.php#January22_2002&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;.  Surely you wouldn&#39;t say after some genuine &lt;em&gt;reflection&lt;/em&gt; and engagement with logic.  Let me be a little critical and note the unfounded slides and slips in that paragraph.  
&lt;p class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;(None of this ought to be taken to say I don&#39;t like Mitsu&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.syntheticzero.com/&#34;&gt;Synthetic Zero&lt;/a&gt; -- it&#39;s deep, interesting, and lots of fun to read.  It&#39;s just that when it comes to logic, he&#39;s wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &#34;The problem with logic is not that it is wrong or useless, but that it is too simple.&#34;  Logic is too simple for &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?  Unpack the unstated part here.  Nothing is &#34;too simple&#34; by itself.  It&#39;s too simple for this, or that, or something else.  What is logic too simple for?  Hammers are too simple to be the solution to the problem of injustice in this world, but it would be misleading to say that hammers are too simple, just because of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe hammers are just fine for some tasks -- maybe they&#39;re fine for the tasks for which their designed.  I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; the same might be the case for logic.
&lt;li&gt;&#34;A logical proposition is always stated within a formal system as either true or false. But real-world propositions only make sense in context...&#34;  But hang on: why are being stated in a formal system and being true or false supposed to be in tension with and making sense in only in a context ?  That&#39;s like saying &#34;A good pasta is always made with extra virgin olive oil.  But pasta they serve here is only available on Wednesdays.&#34;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;...and they [real world propositions] are often dynamic...&#34;  I never knew that formal systems had difficulties with modelling dynamic phenomena.  Tell that to the applied mathematicians.
&lt;li&gt; &#34;Real-world propositions also rarely map into absolute truth values --- is &#34;it is hot&#34; true or false?&#34;
Hang on.  When did the talk of truth values in logic become talk of &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; truth values?  Does the fact that something is stated in a formal system give it a kind of sheen or stature not otherwise available to it?  
&lt;li&gt; Still on whether or not it&#39;s hot: &#34;it&#39;s hot&#34; is true if and only if it&#39;s hot.  Any vagueness or context sensitivity in our ascription of truth to the claim is inherited from the vagueness and context sensitivity in the claim itself.  This holds whether we want to talk about its truth in the vernacular, or whether we represent it formally by assigning &#34;truth values&#34;.  They&#39;re no &lt;em&gt;mystery&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; &#34;Logic is a toy, like a set of building blocks...&#34;  Yes, logic is a toy, but it&#39;s lots of other things too.  It&#39;s a picture, a theory, a body of law, and many many other things indeed. 
&lt;/ol&gt;
This critique of logic is not unlike a critique you might make of counting: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&#34;To say that there are five apples in the bowl is to miss out on the rich dynamic properties of the apples.  Some time ago there were seven, now there are five, and tomorrow there might be three, or there might be eight.  Talk of &lt;em&gt;counting&lt;/em&gt; the apples leads to ignoring their other rich properties of their texture, flavour, colour, and their individuality.  Apples are in a state of flux.  You can never say when an apple blossom makes the transition to being an &lt;em&gt;apple&lt;/em&gt;, and when a rotten apple finally ceases being an apple and becomes one with the earth in the compost heap.  To count the apples is to abstract away from the dynamic flow of the world around us.&#34;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yes, of course to count is to abstract away from other things.  All talk of things is not-talking of other things.  But to say somethings and not others is not necessarily to speak falsely.  To talk of truth or falsity is to ignore many of the other rich phenomena which are a part of speech and reason and dialogue and imagination.  But again, it&#39;s not necessarily a mistake.  If you can&#39;t count, you miss out on some of the rich phenomena in the world around you.  If you can&#39;t reason, if you don&#39;t have some idea of the logical connections between things, you&#39;re missing out on an incredible amount. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-23.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.themoscowtimes.com/&#34;&gt;Moscow Times&lt;/a&gt; is a great English language daily with news from Russia.  I was put on to it by some fun Russian students (Hi Anna! Hi Dmitry!) at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/esslli/&#34;&gt;ESSLLI 2001&lt;/a&gt; in Finland.  Their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.themoscowtimes.com/indexes/146.html&#34;&gt;reflection on the 1991 coup attempt&lt;/a&gt; 10 years later is especially good reading.  When you read things like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&#34;Ten years ago, Vladimir Putin was an aide to St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, who quickly sided with President Boris Yeltsin in opposing the Communist coup in August 1991. But what role Putin played is much less clear.&#34;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
you know that you&#39;re reading some interesting investigative journalism.  See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/08/20/003.html&#34;&gt;whole article&lt;/a&gt; for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

The era of 12 hour workdays has ended for me. (And when I did slave at work for 12 hours a day it was never drudgery, being fortunate enough to have a job which aligns pretty closely with what I love doing anyway.)  Having a child has seen to that.  Looking after him has pushed many things aside.  I just hope it has pushed the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; things aside, leaving a balanced sort of existence.  But to be in my place, to be able to &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; such questions, and to have the flexibility to organise my life in a reasonable way, is a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-19.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Dummett is an enormously influential analytic philosopher who has worked on logic and the philosophy of language.  His work is often thought of as difficult and very abstract.  He is also a committed campaigner for the cause of refugees.  Here is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,495149,00.html&#34;&gt;an example of his writing on the topic&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ve just read his book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415227089/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;On Immigration and Refugees&lt;/a&gt;.  Read it if you&#39;re interested in understanding the rights and wrongs of the ebb and flow of people across borders in this world.  (I wish I had seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/s355566.htm&#34;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; on Australian TV months ago.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday it transpired that we had little in the house to offer our supper guests when they came over after Zack was asleep.  I checked the pantry, and once I obtained a few easy-to-get items (like eggs) we had enough to make some simple chocholate brownies. They were dead simple to prepare (eggs, butter, cocoa, flour, sugar, baking powder -- then bake, cool and slice) and rewardingly delicious to eat.
&lt;p&gt;
I am embarrassed to admit that at this ripe old age of 33, this was the first time I&#39;d ever baked any cake-like thing which wasn&#39;t a packet mix.  After this experience, I am thoroughly convinced that packet cakes are purely designed to rip you off.  Making things from first principles is much more fun, and no more difficult.  I am now officially sworn off packet mixes.

NASA&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/&#34;&gt;Visible Earth&lt;/a&gt; site has &lt;a href=&#34;http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/viewrecord?10897&#34;&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the smoke from the fires in New South Wales in December and January.  There was a great deal of smoke, given that it trailed many hundreds of kilometres out into the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;17&#34;&gt;2002/01/17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-17.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting reading awaits you at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gac.edu/~poconnor/index.html&#34;&gt;Philosophers on Holiday&lt;/a&gt;.  In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gac.edu/~poconnor/about.html&#34;&gt;their own words&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Philosophers on Holiday&lt;/em&gt; is a quarterly &#39;zine launched in the summer of 1997 as the &#34;hippest, nowest, coolest thing in the philosophical travel-and-leisure genre.&#34;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Take time to immerse yourself in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gac.edu/~poconnor/sports/not_dancing.html&#34;&gt;The General Theory of Not Dancing&lt;/a&gt;.  There are some pearls of wisdom there.
&lt;p&gt;
Now be honest: you didn&#39;t know there was a &lt;em&gt;philosophical travel-and-leisure genre&lt;/em&gt;, did you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;15&#34;&gt;2002/01/15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-15.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;em&gt;thought provoking&lt;/em&gt; Christmas gift was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312228643/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;A Force More Powerful&lt;/a&gt;, a thought provoking book about non-violent conflict in the 20th Century.  The authors discuss the famous cases such as Gandhi&#39;s campaign against the raj&#39;s salt tax in India, the Solidarity movement in Poland, and the campaigns for civil rights in the American South.  These were interesting enough.  But the discussions of other areas of conflict even more compelling.  I had no idea of the French and Belgian invasion of the Ruhr in 1923, or about the campaign to oust General Mart&amp;iacute;nez from El Salvador in 1943.  The discussion of the intifada in Palestine, including the examination of the tensions between those who take violence to be an essential part of the struggle and those who don&#39;t, is apposite right now, too. 
&lt;p&gt;
The central message in the book is the important role that citizens of a country have in providing &lt;em&gt;legitimacy&lt;/em&gt; for the powers that be, and the way that this legitimacy can be withdrawn, and hence, the legs cut out from under a power, by nonviolent means.  Eschewing violence is not simply a moral choice -- it may also be a strategic one.  If you use violence against a regime, then this may be seen to legitimate a violent response by the regime itself, and in consequence, lend the regime a legitimacy that it doesn&#39;t otherwise deserve.  It&#39;s interesting and important food for thought.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;13&#34;&gt;2002/01/13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-13.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This photo is a detail from a larger shot I took roughly this time last year.  It&#39;s interesting how a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/iphoto&#34;&gt;new program&lt;/a&gt; gives you a totally new way of looking at pictures you&#39;ve had for ages.  Putting my 1023 (so far) digital shots into a little database, tagging them with simple descriptions like (&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sydney&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Holidays&lt;/em&gt; etc) and then browsing the collection looking for all pictures &lt;em&gt;of Zachary at home&lt;/em&gt;, or all pictures &lt;em&gt;of when we&#39;re having holidays but staying in Sydney&lt;/em&gt; gives you a different and interesting insight into what you&#39;ve been doing in the last year.  
&lt;p&gt;
For the rest of this month, I&#39;ll treat you with little details from shots taken last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;11&#34;&gt;2002/01/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-11.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well why &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; everything the way that it is?  Well, if you work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webspawner.com/users/linkeverything/&#34;&gt;M. C. George&lt;/a&gt; you might be able to find out.  (Don&#39;t you think that the name &#34;M. C. George&#34; makes him sound like he or she is a late 20th Century rap artist?)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;10&#34;&gt;2002/01/10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2002-01-10.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m slowly clawing my way back on top of work, after an enjoyable (but tiring!) Christmas to New Year break in Brisbane seeing family and friends.  My computer has finally arrived, repaired, after an 8 week hiatus, so I can get back to writing rather more efficiently than before.  And there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; things which need writing, so you won&#39;t be hearing from me here very much, I&#39;m afraid.
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, by the way, tomorrow I turn thirty-three.  That&#39;s not quite a third of a century, but pretty close to it.  (I&#39;ve entertained ideas of holding a &#34;33-and-a-third&#34; party, which by my reckoning, should be around May 13.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;18&#34;&gt;2001/12/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&#34;/images/ZackReclining.jpg &#34;WIDTH=&#34;500&#34; HEIGHT=&#34;500&#34; BORDER=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#39;sml&#39;&gt;Zack reclining, by the pool (Fremantle, November 2001)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow, we pile into the car, and start the drive up to Brisbane to spend Christmas with family.  We&#39;re looking forward to a relaxing and refreshing Christmas break, and I hope you have something similar to that too.  See you sometime in 2002.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;13&#34;&gt;2001/12/13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://maths.newcastle.edu.au/~rking/&#34;&gt;Robert King&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m listening to the first radio series of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zz9.org/&#34;&gt;Hitch-Hiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;.  I first read the first book in 1981, and listened to the radio series soon after. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve read or listened to them, and as you&#39;d expect, it sounds pretty different, given the years of elapsed.
&lt;p&gt;
I now notice how repetitive the dramatic devices become.  It would be nice if some of the dramatic tension did not involve Our Heroes facing certain (if only apparent) death, only to be rescued by a wildly improbable occurence.  But then, the plot is not the most important or interesting thing about the series.  It&#39;s merely a skeleton on which to hang the humour: both the &lt;em&gt;jokes&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Douglas Adams&#39; tone is fundamentally &lt;em&gt;sympathetic&lt;/em&gt;. He really does appear to have genuine affection for his characters and their silly beliefs, customs or habits.  There are no genuine &lt;em&gt;evils&lt;/em&gt; in this universe: just different crazy people facing absurdity.
&lt;p&gt;
Adams&#39; humour is rooted in his &lt;em&gt;observation&lt;/em&gt;.  The best jokes (the philosophers&#39; union; the planet-builders who put themselves to sleep for millions of years to last out a galactic recession, etc, etc) all give you a new way of viewing our world, and not just Adams&#39; imaginary world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;12&#34;&gt;2001/12/12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m enjoying &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/brkfast/robertson.htm&#34;&gt;Clive Robertson&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/&#34;&gt;Radio National&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/brkfast/&#34;&gt;Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; program.  He knows how to interview people, he has a brain, he has opinions, and he&#39;s self-deprecatingly funny.  It&#39;s a pity he&#39;s only on for six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;11&#34;&gt;2001/12/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; interesting reading for me.  Wilfrid Hodges on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/200110/comm-hodges.pdf&#34;&gt;What you might want from your (academic) publisher&lt;/a&gt;.  I must read it carefully before I sign the contract on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;10&#34;&gt;2001/12/10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing my first-year lecture preparation -- writing lectures on David Hume on God and the Self -- I&#39;ve found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.utm.edu/research/hume/&#34;&gt;Hume Archives&lt;/a&gt; pretty useful.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/&#34;&gt;David Hume entry&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; is a nice introduction to Hume too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;07&#34;&gt;2001/12/07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It transpires that in 2002 I will be the president of the &lt;em&gt;Australasian Association for Logic&lt;/em&gt;.  This does not mean that I wield an &lt;em&gt;inordinate&lt;/em&gt; amount of spiritual or temporal power, but it does mean that I will give the presidential address at the 2002 conference in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;06&#34;&gt;2001/12/06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only have some friends (both online and friends &#34;in the flesh&#34;) appreciated last month&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archive/2001/11&#34;&gt;extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;, but so have people I&#39;ve admired but never met.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/research/graff/index.html&#34;&gt;Delia Graff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/research/graff/philosophy.html&#34;&gt;linked to the page&lt;/a&gt; and emailed me with nice words about it today.  This is good, because I &lt;a href=&#34;http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/research/graff/olpapers.html&#34;&gt;like her research too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;05&#34;&gt;2001/12/05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates here are going to be very sporadic, even though I&#39;ve finished teaching for the year.  I&#39;ve got lots to do in the next few months, and not lots of time to do it.  Here&#39;s a short list so that you can picture what I&#39;m doing instead of providing you things to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Write drafts of my chapters of &lt;em&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/em&gt; which I&#39;m co-writing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Change nappies.
&lt;li&gt; Write six lectures on &lt;em&gt;Hume on God and the Self&lt;/em&gt; for a first-year philosophy class.
&lt;li&gt; Steam and blend fruit and vegetable concoctions.
&lt;li&gt; Write four book reviews.
&lt;li&gt; Shop for groceries.
&lt;li&gt; Finish reading two of the books I need to review.
&lt;li&gt; Shop for Christmas presents.
&lt;li&gt; Write up exercises for my upper level logic class.
&lt;li&gt; Write our Christmas letter for 2001.
&lt;li&gt; Write a class outline and reading list for my honours class on history of philosophy.
&lt;li&gt; Drive to Brisbane for Christmas with the family.
&lt;li&gt; Write a grant proposal.
&lt;li&gt; Take Zachary for regular walks in the stroller.
&lt;li&gt; Sort out my unfinished &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Spend time at the beach or the pool, helping Zachary learn to swim.
&lt;li&gt; Figure out how to get my web-based material for first year logic to work with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt; they use at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Read some interesting books.
&lt;li&gt; Finish the &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; final edits on my logic textbook.
&lt;li&gt; Spend time with Christine.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s more than this, but you get the idea.  I sometimes cringe when students ask me if I&#39;ve had a nice long holiday, when we return to classes.  It&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;lecture free period&lt;/em&gt;, not necessarily a holiday.
&lt;p&gt;
Everything on that list has a higher priority than regular updates here.  You&#39;ll understand, I hope, why updates on this site might be sparse in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;04&#34;&gt;2001/12/04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 9:36pm and I&#39;ve just completed grading my large first year logic unit.  It&#39;s draining, deciding grades and hence exerting a significant influence on the future directions of lives.  Deciding exactly where in the list of students I&#39;d cut between a pass and a conceded pass, and between a conceded pass and a fail, is never a simple or painless decision.
&lt;p&gt;
Especially this year, where no matter where I could sensibly cut it, at least 17% of my students would fail in one way or another.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;2001/12/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for keeping up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_11&#34;&gt;November&#39;s Great Moments in Logic&lt;/a&gt;.  It was fun to write, and I hope it was fun for you to read too.  (Maybe I&#39;ll brush them up and make a little book, I&#39;m not sure.)  Anyway, here&#39;s a present for all of the Macintosh users out there.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/logicians/Logicians.sit&#34;&gt;A Stuffit Archive of a Folder of Icons of each of the logicians&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes, you too can grace your desktop with images of Boole, Peano, Russell, Cantor, Husserl and the gang! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;Jon Barwise (1942-2000)&lt;/H3&gt;


Jon Barwise was a &lt;em&gt;renaissance logician&lt;/em&gt;.  He didn&#39;t know &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; but his contributions ranged so widely that he approximated omniscience quite well.  His work &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-vil.cs.indiana.edu/kjbpubls.html&#34;&gt;ranges from&lt;/a&gt; infinitary logic (an extension of Frege-style predicate logic to deal with infinitely long sentences, and infinitary quantifiers), the model theory of first-order logic (continuing on from Tarski&#39;s work), generalsed quantifiers (quantifiers other than &#34;for all&#34; and &#34;for some&#34;), admissible sets and generalised recursion theory (the connections between sets and computation), situation semantics and the philosophy of language (using &lt;em&gt;situations&lt;/em&gt;, restricted parts of the world as bearers of information, rather than just entire possible worlds), information theory (an account of how information flows and is transmitted), and the logic of &lt;em&gt;diagrams&lt;/em&gt; (examining visual representation and inference, as well as linguistic representation).
&lt;p&gt;
Barwise&#39;s work, in all of 35 years, has covered a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; range of disciplines, and it gives you some idea of the breadth of work available in contemporary logic.  Barwise&#39;s approach of regularly moving into new fields, to keep fresh and active, is a helpful antidote in the current age of increasing specialisation and narrowing.  If work like this is possible at the end of the 20th Century, it will be our job to see what might be done in the 21st.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Lewis.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Lewis]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;David Lewis (1941-2001)&lt;/H3&gt;


David Lewis is famous not only for his great impact on analytic philosophy (perhaps this impact is felt most keenly in Australia, a country he loved and visited regularly) but also on the reaction that his philosophical views provoked.  Lewis&#39; &lt;em&gt;modal realism&lt;/em&gt;, the view that other possible worlds are just as real, and just as real in exactly the same way as this world we live in, famously and regularly  provokes an &lt;em&gt;incredulous stare&lt;/em&gt; from people when they hear that he believes it quite literally.
&lt;p&gt;
Lewis is a good example of a philosopher whose work is the consequence of the work of others.  This is not to deny his creative output or originality in any way: it is a creative work to spell out the consequences of a view, and no body of work in this area is richer or more well developed than Lewis&#39;.  David Lewis&#39; view, I think, can be seen as what you get when you cross Quine&#39;s ontological views (his extensionalism) with the intensionalism you find in Kripke&#39;s and others&#39; work on modal logic.  Lewis acknowledges that modal notions (possibility and necessity and the like) are important, meaningful, and to be found in any theory we take seriously.  From Quine, he takes the ontological commitment of a theory to be read off what the theory &lt;em&gt;quantifies over&lt;/em&gt; (Quine&#39;s dictum is &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jcu.edu/philosophy/gensler/ap/quine-00.htm&#34;&gt;to be is to be the value of a variable&lt;/a&gt;&#34;.)  Modality is important and it makes sense.  Our way of understanding modality is to quantify over possible worlds in semantics in the tradition of Kripke.  Voila: modal realism.
&lt;p&gt;
Lewis&#39; work on this topic, especially in the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631224262/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;On the Plurality of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; is a compendium of what follows from taking this metaphysical picture seriously, and the kinds of philosophical applications the notions of possible worlds might have.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;28&#34;&gt;2001/11/28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Kripke.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Kripke]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Saul Kripke (1940-)&lt;/H3&gt;


Saul Kripke was a precocious teenager when his work revolutionised intensional logic.  For many years people had known that the logic of &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; had a coherence all of its own, and many people had strived to give it a plausible and satisfying formal &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;.  This was to change in the work of a teenaged Kripke, published in 1959 (&#34;A completeness theorem in modal logic&#34;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Symbolic Logic&lt;/em&gt;, pages 1 to 15 of volume 24).  In this paper, Kripke exploited the well-worn notion of a possible world, and introduced the notion of &#34;relative possibility&#34; as a relationship between &#34;possible worlds&#34;.  Then we could say that a formula &#34;necessarily &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&#34; is true at a world if and only if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true at all worlds which are possible relative to the original world, and &#34;possibly &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&#34; is true at a world if and only if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true at some worlds which are possible relative to the original world.
&lt;p&gt;
The notion of possible worlds is not original with Kripke.  Neither, in fact, is the use of something like a relative possibility (or &#34;accessibility&#34;) relation.  However, putting these things together in a neat bundle, and showing how a number of studied modal systems can be understood in this light, &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; new, and this generated a whole new field of study: the possible worlds semantics for modal and other intensional logics.  
&lt;p&gt;
Kripke went on to work in many different areas in philosophy, including some influential &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674954017/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;work on Wittegenstein&lt;/a&gt; and other areas of metaphysics and the philosophy of language.  His mark on logic,
however, was already made in that paper written as a teenager.
&lt;p&gt;
More information about Kripke&#39;s work in &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt; can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/552540&#34;&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; on him.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Marcus.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Marcus]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Ruth Barcan Marcus (1921-)&lt;/H3&gt;


Ruth Barcan Marcus is another &lt;em&gt;intensionalist&lt;/em&gt; like Prior.  She was a strong defender of the up-and-coming work on modal logic, in the tradition of Prior and others.  (More on this tomorrow.)  Quine was an ardent critic of intensional logic, especially when combined with quantification.  Ruth Barcan (later Ruth Barcan Marcus) showed that on a plausible conception of how &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; worked, the following thesis turns out to be true:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that something has property &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;,
then there is something such that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; possibly has poperty &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, this might be a problem.  After all, if we think it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that there be an object with atomic number 150, does it follow that we should think that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some stuff such that it &lt;em&gt;could be&lt;/em&gt; matter with atomic number 150?  It&#39;s kind-of odd to think that this must be so, but on a straightforward understanding of how modality and possibility works (that every &#34;world&#34; has the same &#34;domain&#34;: more on this later) this is how things turn out.
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/actualism/index.html&#34;&gt;debates arising out of the combination of modality and quantification&lt;/a&gt; are by no means over.  Ruth Barcan Marcus&#39; sharp analysis has focussed the discussion of these topics for decades.

&lt;H3&gt;Helena Rasiowa (1917-1994)&lt;/H3&gt;


At &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt;, a woman!  The month is nearly at an end, and at last, I have found a female logician to join our list of stars.  Helena Rasiowa was an incredible logician from Poland, who helped place the study of &lt;em&gt;logics&lt;/em&gt; on a mathematical footing.  Continuing on the work of Boole and Lukasiewicz, she showed, in her groundbreaking book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0720422647/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;An Algebraic Approach to Non-Classical Logics&lt;/a&gt; showed how contemporary techniques in &lt;em&gt;algebra&lt;/em&gt; may be used to study the structures of propositions arising out of different conceptions of logic.  This book is rich in ideas and treatments of Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras (models of intuitionistic logic), the many valued logics of Lukasiewicz, and others.  This is one of the first books to give a unified treatment of &lt;em&gt;logics&lt;/em&gt; rather than a partisan development of this system or that system.
&lt;p&gt;
Rasiowa&#39;s work also encouraged me as a budding mathematics student, to go into logic.  Browsing through &lt;a href=&#34;http://library.uq.edu.au/search/arasiowa+helena/arasiowa+helena/1,1,4,B/frameset&amp;amp;F=arasiowa+helena&amp;amp;1,,4&#34;&gt;its pages&lt;/a&gt; in the old University of Queensland Mathematics Library, I saw that the things I was learning in algebra could be used to illuminate my growing interests in logic.
&lt;p&gt;
More information about Rasiowa can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Rasiowa.html&#34;&gt;St. Andrews&#39; History of Mathematics Entry&lt;/a&gt; on her.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Prior.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Prior]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Arthur Prior (1914-1969)&lt;/H3&gt;


Arthur Prior is the first (and only) &lt;em&gt;antipodean&lt;/em&gt; logician on this list.  Educated in New Zealand, he had academic positions both in New Zealand (at Otago and Canterbury) and in England (at Manchester, and Oxford).  Prior invented the field of &lt;em&gt;tense logic&lt;/em&gt;, the logic of &#34;earlier&#34; and &#34;later&#34;, &#34;past&#34; and &#34;future&#34;.  He was the arch &lt;em&gt;intensionalist&lt;/em&gt;, bringing to the philosophical fore these &lt;em&gt;modalities&lt;/em&gt; which are not truth-functional, not obviously amenable to Tarski&#39;s analysis of truth-in-a-model.  Remember that in Tarki&#39;s world, the truth or otherwise of a complex expression depends on the truth or otherwise of its components.  The &lt;em&gt;temporal&lt;/em&gt; operators don&#39;t work like this at all.  &#34;it&#39;s raining&#34; and &#34;it&#39;s Thursday&#34; might both be true, but &#34;yesterday it rained&#34; and &#34;yesterday it was Thursday&#34; might differ in truth value. The truth or falsity of temporal operators is &lt;em&gt;intensional&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;extensional&lt;/em&gt;.  It depends on more than just the truth value of the components.
&lt;p&gt;
There is a tradition in logic to attempt to erase the intensional by making it genuinely &lt;em&gt;extensional&lt;/em&gt; (replacing talk of &#34;it rained&#34; by &#34;it rained on day &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&#34; and explicitly quantifying over days or times) -- Quine&#39;s work is a very good example of this -- but Prior resisted this move strongly.  For Prior, there was nothing wrong with irreducable intensionality, provided that you could be clear about the logical properties these intensional creatures satisfied.  Prior&#39;s work did a great deal to rehabilitate the intensional and to put it on an equal footing with the extensional tradition in logic.  This work would explode onto the scene with some developments of Kripke and what is now known as &#34;possible worlds semantics&#34;, but it was Prior&#39;s work which set the scene and showed the enormous range of philosophical applicability of these ideas.

&lt;p&gt;
Excellent information about Prior can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.canterbury.ac.nz/jack_copeland/&#34;&gt;Jack Copeland&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prior/&#34;&gt;entry on Prior in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;H3&gt;Alan Turing (1912-1954)&lt;/H3&gt;


Alan Turing is famous for the &lt;em&gt;Turing Test&lt;/em&gt; (a claim about what it would take for something to count as &lt;em&gt;intelligent&lt;/em&gt;: get it to communicate with you in conversation over a network connection) for &lt;em&gt;Turing Machines&lt;/em&gt;, and for half of the name of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/church-turing/&#34;&gt;Church-Turing Thesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.   I think that the latter two are more interesting from the point of view of logic than the first one.
&lt;p&gt;
Turing Machines are not really &lt;em&gt;machines&lt;/em&gt; at all.  The idea of a Turing machine is that of a characterisation of a &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; computing device, and it&#39;s the kind of computational device stripped down to its limit.  All it involves is a long tape divided into segments (picture a roll of toilet paper unrolled).  The tape is &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that if you ever get to an end, you can go out to the shop and get some more to add on.  So, you never run out of tape.  Then, you have a marker where you can write a sign on a square of the tape.  (You can overwrite an existing sign with a new sign too: the new sign replaces the old one.)  You have a finite collection of possible signs, including the blank sign for a square which has no other sign written on it.  You also have a finite set of &lt;em&gt;states&lt;/em&gt; which you can think of as points on a flowchart.  The &lt;em&gt;instructions&lt;/em&gt; are the arrows on a flow chart which say things like this:  If you&#39;re in this state, and you&#39;re looking at a square with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; symbol on it, then follow &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; instruction, and go to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; state.  What&#39;s an instruction?  It can be one of three things.  It&#39;s either to write a sign in the square you&#39;re looking at, or move left one square and look at this new square, or move right one square.  That&#39;s it.  If you&#39;re in a state looking at a symbol on a square and you have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; instruction to follow, your computation simply stops.
&lt;p&gt;
That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s all there is to a Turing machine.  It&#39;s not exactly the kind of computer you can use for word-processing, or playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.idsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; with.  However, the kinds of computations you can do on this kind of machine (especially when you think of representing numbers on the machine using some code) are a really natural class of functions.  They&#39;re the &lt;em&gt;recursive&lt;/em&gt; functions, independently characterised by Church.  And the Church-Turing thesis is the claim that this class of functions is exactly the class of functions which could be &lt;em&gt;computed&lt;/em&gt; using any computational device.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Gentzen.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Gentzen]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Gerhard Gentzen (1909-1945)&lt;/H3&gt;


Gerhard Gentzen brought the study of logic to a completely new level with his work on the theory of &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;.  Logicians, since Aristotle, have been interested not only in what you can prove, but also in proof itself.  But somewhat suprisingly, up until Gentzen&#39;s time, no-one had a coherent story to tell about what a proof actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; and what logical properties proofs might have.  Gentzen&#39;s work changed this, and he is now seen as the archetypal &lt;em&gt;proof theorist&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Gentzen&#39;s innovation was to introduce proof as an object of study.  He formalised two different kinds of proofs, which we now call &lt;em&gt;Natural Deduction&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gentzen Systems&lt;/em&gt; in his honour.  A Gentzen system is an interesting kind of way of proving things, because unlike other kinds of proof, a Gentzen proof is not a series of statements, each of which follows from earlier statements in the series.  (A Natural deduction proof is like this, except that statements may be &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; and assumptions may also be &lt;em&gt;discharged&lt;/em&gt; at different points in the proof.)  A Gentzen proof is very different: at each stage of a Gentzen proof, you prove not &lt;em&gt;statements&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;sequents&lt;/em&gt;.  A sequent is not an individual statement, but rather, a claim saying that one statement follows from other statements.  One way of thinking about it (and this was Gentzen&#39;s own way of thinking about it) is that a Gentzen proof is a proof &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; other proofs.  The steps don&#39;t say things like &#34;this follows from that&#34; but &#34;if there&#39;s a proof of B from A then there&#39;s a proof of C from A too&#34;.
&lt;p&gt;
Gentzen systems are beautiful because they give you a deeper understanding of what can be done with proofs.  One of Gentzen&#39;s own applications was to use a Gentzen system for Peano Arithmetic to show that arithmetic was indeed consistent.  Gentzen&#39;s argument is quite clever.  He shows that there is no way that you could get a proof of an inconsistency from the axioms because any such proof could be transformed into a  &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; proof of an inconsistency from the axioms, and there&#39;s no one-step proof of an inconsistency.  (Actually, the proof is a bit trickier than this, as it&#39;s a corollary of Gentzen&#39;s famous &lt;em&gt;Cut Elimination Theorem&lt;/em&gt;, but this is the core of the way that the result is proved, if you think about it for a bit!)
&lt;p&gt;
This result might be seen to be in conflict with G&amp;ouml;del&#39;s incompleteness result, which has a corollary that Peano&#39;s arithmetic can&#39;t prove its own consistency.  However, there&#39;s no conflict, as Gentzen&#39;s techniques, though straightforward, actually presume something &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; that arithmetic itself.  These techniques use a form of mathematical induction stronger than that supplied in ordinary arithmetic.  This result has spawned many more like it, and the study of the relative proof-theoretical strength of different theories is now a well-understood discipline in logic.

&lt;H3&gt;W. V. O. Quine (1908-2000)&lt;/H3&gt;


Quine is not famous for his &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; so much as for the mark he made on philosophy in the english-speaking world in the second half of the twentieth century.  However, he was a formidable logician, with contributions in set theory (his &lt;em&gt;New Foundations&lt;/em&gt; is an alternative view of the set-theoretic universe, radically at odds with the Zermelo-Fraenkel picture inspired by Cantor) and other areas of logic.  However, it was his imprint on &lt;em&gt;philosophy as a whole&lt;/em&gt; for which Quine is rightly remembered.
&lt;p&gt;
The centre of Quine&#39;s contribution can be seen in his work on &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;holist&lt;/em&gt; picture radically at odds with Carnap&#39;s view of how language works.  For Carnap, the &lt;em&gt;meaning postulates&lt;/em&gt; governing a discourse show us how the language works, and once you have the meaning postulates (the &lt;em&gt;analytic&lt;/em&gt; truths) the &#34;world&#34; contributes the rest, the (the &lt;em&gt;synthetic&lt;/em&gt; truths).
The analytic truths don&#39;t tell us anything &lt;em&gt;about the world&lt;/em&gt; but the synthetic truths do.  This is a compelling picture, and it&#39;s one that has basically been the received doctrine in understanding language and concepts, from the British Empiricists, through Kant, and up to the middle 20th Century.  Of course, the picture has not been a uniform one.  Kant argued that some synthetic truths were knowable &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, and the work in logic in the early 19th and 20th Centuries greatly expanded our understanding of what might count as &#34;analytic&#34;.  However, everyone agreed that there was a sensible distinction to be drawn between the analytic and the synthetic.
&lt;p&gt;
Quine changed all of that.  With novel arguments and though experiments (in particular, the problem of &lt;em&gt;radical translation&lt;/em&gt;: see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262670011/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Word and Object&lt;/a&gt; and the famous article &#34;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&#34;) Quine set about to dismantle the analytic/synthetic distinction.  For Quine, any body of theory cannot be unambiguously split into analytic and synthetic components, where the synthetic is prone to revision and the analytic immune from revision.   The body of theory is to be considered as a whole, and judged in this way.  Quine was the first explicit empiricist &lt;em&gt;holist&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
To this day, anyone who takes the analytic/synthetic distinction seriously owes a debt to explain how it is to be understood, in the face of Quine&#39;s arguments.  For bringing this important issue to light, Quine is to be praised!

&lt;H3&gt;Kurt G&amp;ouml;del (1906-1978)&lt;/H3&gt;


G&amp;ouml;del&#39;s &lt;em&gt;incompleteness theorem&lt;/em&gt; is great in two ways.  First, it&#39;s the technical result in logic most cited outside its field. Second, it&#39;s a stunning piece of reasoning which genuinely broke open a new field and closed off other areas of inquiry.
&lt;p&gt;
G&amp;ouml;del&#39;s incompleteness theorem shows that Peano&#39;s theory of arithmetic is essentially &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt;.  For some sentences in the language of arithmetic, it cannot decide between that sentence and its negation.  G&amp;ouml;del shows that this is not an accidental feature of Peano&#39;s theory, to be fixed with a little patch here or there.  No, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; theory of arithmetic which is such that you can tell (by means of a recursive function: look to &lt;em&gt;Turing&#39;s entry&lt;/em&gt; coming on up) whether or not something is an &lt;em&gt;axiom&lt;/em&gt; of the theory, then exactly the same incompleteness phenomenon will hold.  Why is this?  It&#39;s because an arithmetic theory is rich enough to &lt;em&gt;represent&lt;/em&gt; in some sense, it&#39;s own facts about &lt;em&gt;provability&lt;/em&gt;.  That is, it can simulate provability in its own claims about numbers.  G&amp;ouml;del showed how claims about sentences and proofs can be &#34;encoded&#34; into claims about numbers, in such a way that if there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a proof of some claim, then there is a proof in arithmetic which represents that proof.  Once you&#39;ve pulled this trick (it&#39;s the trick of &lt;em&gt;G&amp;ouml;del numbering&lt;/em&gt;), you then need to pull another trick (called &lt;em&gt;diagonalisation&lt;/em&gt;, it&#39;s close in spirit to Cantor&#39;s diagonal argument) to construct a sentence which, in effect says
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am not provable in Peano&#39;s Arithmetic
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If this sentence &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; provable in Peano&#39;s arithmetic, then since provability in this arithmetic implies truth, it is not provable in Peano&#39;s arithmetic, and as a result the arithmetic is inconsistent.  On the other hand, if it&#39;s not provable in Peano&#39;s arithmetic, then it itself is an example of a sentence which is true but is not provable: and as a result, the arithmetic is incomplete.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, there&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; that can be said about this result.  And there&#39;s a lot of garbage that has been said about this result too (so called &#34;applications&#34; range from theories of the mind, of culture, of value, of art, of this that and the other).  It think it&#39;s stunning enough in its original form.  And working out its implications for logical theories, and knowing when (and on what basis) we can claim consistency or completeness, is plenty interesting enough.

&lt;H3&gt;Alonzo Church (1903-1994)&lt;/H3&gt;


Alonzo Church&#39;s influence over logic is long-lived, as he was.  I&#39;ll focus on just two ways he has left his mark on the field.
First, and most obvious, was his invention of the &lt;em&gt;lambda calculus&lt;/em&gt;.  This is a notion for representing functions, immensely suited to the same body of theory as Curry&#39;s &lt;em&gt;combinatory logic&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact, Church&#39;s notation for functional abstraction (using a &lt;em&gt;lambda&lt;/em&gt;, which I&#39;ll write here with a backslash &#34;&lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;&#34;) is a uniform technique which, when combined with functional application, gives you exactly the same theory as Curry&#39;s combinators.  The notation is simple.  The addition function can be represented like this: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;\x\y(x+y)&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It&#39;s a function, which when applied to a number (say 2) gives you the result &lt;tt&gt;\y(2+y)&lt;/tt&gt;.  You figure out how it works by taking the first lambda abstraction out the front, removing it, and replacing the variables inside the rest which were bound by that abstraction, by the value you chose.  The result is still a function.  If you apply this to another number (say 3) you get the result 2+3.  So addition here is a function which takes two values, and returns a number.
&lt;p&gt;
More can be said about the lambda calculus, and its use as a language for representing functional abstraction.  I want to go on to consider what might have been Church&#39;s greatest achievement.  He founded, in 1936, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aslonline.org/asl/JSL/JSL.html&#34;&gt;Journal of Symbolic Logic&lt;/a&gt; in 1936, along with its parent body, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aslonline.org/&#34;&gt;Association for Symbolic Logic&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;em&gt;JSL&lt;/em&gt; is the most prestigious journal in formal logic, and it has played (especially in its early years) a crucial pivotal role in helping define the community of logicians, by giving a focal point for research and a means for disseminating results broadly.  Logicians did not have to resort to scanning over a wide body of mathematics and philosophy journals to find articles of importance to logic.  Now they could concentrate in the one place.

&lt;H3&gt;Frank Ramsey (1903-1930)&lt;/H3&gt;


If I&#39;d done as much as Frank Ramsey had achieved by the time &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was 27, I&#39;d be glad.  Of course, I&#39;m very glad to have made it past 27.
&lt;p&gt;
Ramsey not only did amazing work in the philosophy of logic and probability.  His insight into how &lt;em&gt;theoretical terms&lt;/em&gt; work has earned his surname a place in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=ramsification&#34;&gt;lexicon&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes, Frank Ramsey is responsible for the technique we now delightedly call &lt;em&gt;Ramsification&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Ramsification is a straightforward notion when you get your head around it.  It&#39;s a theoretical application to &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt; of Russell&#39;s account of definite descriptions.  It&#39;s always been a bit of a mystery how theoretical terms like &lt;em&gt;neutrino&lt;/em&gt; actually work.  People started talking about neutrinos (I love the name by the way: &lt;em&gt;little neutral one&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect name for a pet, at least if he/she is placid) before they&#39;d ever found conclusive evidence of their existence.  It&#39;s not like they&#39;d &lt;em&gt;laid eyes&lt;/em&gt; on them and said &#34;I will call this a &lt;em&gt;neutrino&lt;/em&gt;&#34;.  No, what happened instead is that the scientists endorsed a body which included the predicate &#34;is a neutrino&#34;.  The theory will contain things like &#34;Neutrinos have no charge&#34;, &#34;Neutrinos have negligible mass&#34; and other things like this.  Now this theory can have sense, and can &lt;em&gt;assign&lt;/em&gt; a kind of meaning to the term &#34;neutrino&#34; in just the same way as Russell&#39;s analysis of definite descriptions shows how sense is assigned to definite descriptions.  The theoretical term &#34;neutrino&#34; doesn&#39;t really refer, but you can treat the terms as a predicate &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt;, and the theory really says something like
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;(for some X)(X has no charge, and X has negligible mass, and ...)&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And in this way, theoretical terms are introduced into the language.
&lt;p&gt;
This technique has seen a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of use in contemporary work coming out of &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.syr.edu/%7Edpnolan/philosophy/Credo.html&#34;&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;H3&gt;Alfred Tarski (1902-1983)&lt;/H3&gt;


Alfred Tarski&#39;s shadow looms large over 20th Century Logic, and it extends into the 21st Century too.  An emigre from Poland, educated in the great Warsaw school of logicians, Tarski brought a new degree of conceptual clarification to a great number of issues in logic.  I will sketch two here.  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;, Tarski gave the first rigorous definition of what it was for a structure to be a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; or an &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; of the language of predicate logic.  He gave precise clauses indicating for each kind of sentence (atomic sentence, conjunction, disjunction, negation, universally quantified, existentially quantified, etc) what it is for this sentence to be &lt;em&gt;true in&lt;/em&gt; a model.  To do this, he noticed that you need to do something tricky when it comes to &lt;em&gt;quantified&lt;/em&gt; sentences like &lt;tt&gt;for all &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;(if F&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then G&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;.  For this to be given a sensible truth condition, we want its truth to depend on the truth of the part inside the quantifier.  But &lt;tt&gt;if F&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then G&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is not a sentence: it&#39;s got a variable in it unbound.  (It&#39;s like the term &lt;tt&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; + 2&lt;/tt&gt;: you only know what number it is when I tell you the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of the variable &lt;tt&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.)  So, Tarski solved the problem this way.  You don&#39;t define what it is for a sentence to be &lt;em&gt;true in&lt;/em&gt; a model.  You define what it is for a formula (possibly including free variables) together with an &lt;em&gt;assignment of values to each of the variables&lt;/em&gt; to be &lt;em&gt;satisfied by&lt;/em&gt; a model.  So, &lt;tt&gt;for all &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;(if F&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then G&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; together with the assignment &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; is satisfied by my model just when the inside bit &lt;tt&gt;if F&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then G&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; together with any &lt;em&gt;variant&lt;/em&gt; assignment &lt;tt&gt;A&#39;&lt;/tt&gt; which assigns exactly the same values as &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; does to any variable other than &lt;tt&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, but possibly assigns &lt;tt&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; any value it chooses.  This gets the result exactly right.  And it gives a clear (well, after you get used to it, anyway!), rigorous and recursive definition of satisfaction, and truth in a model.
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt; insight is related.  It&#39;s also on the topic of truth.  Here, the idea is not truth in a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt;, but genuine truth.  The kind of truth we attempt to express when we make assertions.  Many philosophers have said deep and mystical things about the Nature of Truth.  Some have said that truth is a matter of Correspondence to Reality (after all, propositions are designed to reflect the Way the World Is).  Others have said that truth is a matter of the Coherence of an overall body of propositions (after all, we test propositions only against other propositions).  Still others have said that truth is a matter of What Gets Things Done (after all, in describing things we always aim to Do something, and this governs the kinds of concepts we have).  Tarski thought that all accounts like this are misguided.  For given a language which doesn&#39;t say anything about truth, it is easy to &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; the notion of truth in that language, without appealing to Correspondence, Coherence, or Pragmatic concerns.  Suppose we&#39;ve got a sentence in our language, like &#34;snow is white&#34;.  (This is a favourite in discussions of truth, for some reason.)  We know very well what the sentence &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt;.  We want to know whether or not the sentence is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;.  Well, given that we know what it means, we can say exactly the conditions under which this sentence is true:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&#34;Snow is white&#34; is true if and only if snow is white
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now this tells us exactly the circumstances under which &#34;snow is white&#34; is true.  And it doesn&#39;t say anything about Correspondence to Reality, Coherence, or Pragmatic concerns.  It is Tarski&#39;s &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of the concept of truth, and it&#39;s become an important benchmark in any discussion of the topic to this day.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;Haskell Curry (1900-1982)&lt;/H3&gt;


Haskell Curry was an American student of Hilbert.  His greatest innovative contributions to logic are in the odd area of &lt;em&gt;combinatory logic&lt;/em&gt;.   Combinators are strange beasts: they&#39;re like functions which operate on other functions.  Combinatory logic is a formal system like other kinds of logic: you have a collection of objects with different rules indicating allowable transformations from objects to other objects.  But these combinators do not necessarily express &lt;em&gt;statements&lt;/em&gt;, as the formulas in a traditional logic do.  They&#39;re &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt;.  
&lt;p&gt;
The frame of mind required to think in this way (to see everything as a function) is important in many fields today, and the debt to Curry is sometimes acknowledged and sometimes not.  For example, in computer science, the transformation required to move from thinking of a function as giving you an output given a &lt;em&gt;pair&lt;/em&gt; of inputs
(for example, addition as a function sending &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;x + y&lt;/em&gt;) to thinking of it as giving a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; as output when given a single input (so given &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; the output is the function which sends &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;x + y&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;em&gt;adding x&lt;/em&gt; function) is called &lt;em&gt;currying&lt;/em&gt; in Curry&#39;s honour.  This kind of transformation, which involves thinking of functions as first-class entities, is important in many disciplines, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory&#34;&gt;category theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;functional programming&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact, my favourite functional programming language &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org/&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; is named after Curry.
&lt;p&gt;
Curry made another very important contribution to the tradition: his textbook &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486634620/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Foundations of Mathematical Logic&lt;/a&gt; is still &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt; with insight, and it rewards reading and rereading today.  It is the first textbook in mathematical logic which takes a synoptic view of different logical systems and which encourages the reader to think philosophically and creatively about the different kinds of formal systems which might be used to model different logical phenomena. 
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;Arend Heyting (1898-1980)&lt;/H3&gt;


Arend Heyting was a brilliant Dutch logician: beardless, as you can see ---  the &lt;em&gt;Return of the Beards&lt;/em&gt; will be quite some decades to come.  Heyting&#39;s claim to fame was to do something quite against the spirit of the intuitionist enterprise, but which made intuitionism a respectable and living (if &lt;em&gt;minority&lt;/em&gt;) tradition in logic.
&lt;p&gt;  
Heyting &lt;em&gt;formalised&lt;/em&gt; intuitionistic logic.  That is, he codified the kinds of inferences which are warranted by the lights of an intuitionist.  This made &#34;intuitionistic logic&#34; an object of study, amenable to many of the same techniques that Frege and others had developed for the dominant tradition in logic, which we now call &#34;classical&#34; logic.

Rudolf Carnap was a German philosopher, educated in the dominant Kantian tradition, interested in science and epistemology (the theory of knowledge).  Carnap had one of the &#34;conversion experiences&#34; common to great evangelists.  While sick one day he read some of the knew &#34;formal&#34; philosophy of Bertrand Russell, and the scales fell from his eyes.  The combination of rigour and philosophical applicability convinced Carnap that from this day henceforth, he wanted to do philosophy like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
And so, Rudolf Carnap worked in the tradition started by Russell, of the application of formal techniques to philosophical problems.  But in Carnap&#39;s hands, these techniques had very different outcomes.  Carnap&#39;s masterworks, the &lt;em&gt;Aufbau&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Logical Syntax of Language&lt;/em&gt; indeed use techniques rather like Russell&#39;s in &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Principles of Logical Atomism&lt;/em&gt; but the resulting philosophical picture cannot be more different.  While Russell was an atomist and foundationalist for many of his years (though what these &lt;em&gt;atoms&lt;/em&gt; might be was ever elusive for Russell), Carnap was temperamentally very different.  He was, by nature, a kind of accommodating pluralist.  He thought that the new logical techniques would help us see what was genuinely being &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; by different philosophical positions, and that we might see the things on which different philosophers agree, and those on which they have genuine disagreements, and those upon which the disagreement is a purely verbal matter.   An example from the philosophy of mathematics might give you an idea of how this works.  In mathematics, we have rules for adjudicating disagreement in many cases: if I say that  37+56=83, then you can show me where I went wrong by explaining how the addition actually works: 37+56 is &lt;em&gt;93&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps I forgot to carry the 10 from the addition of 7 and 6).  Similarly, if I deny that there is a prime number between 11 and 17, you can point out that 13 is a prime number between them.  The &lt;em&gt;meanings&lt;/em&gt; of the mathematical terms dictate how they should be used, and they give us answers in these cases.  They &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; help in the argument between the platonist (who thinks that numbers &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; exist) and the formalist (who thinks that numbers &lt;em&gt;really don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; exist).  If either attempts to get into a discussion with Carnap about whether or not there &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; is a prime number between 11 and 17, he&#39;ll simply say, &#34;yes, there is a prime number between 11 and 17 -- it&#39;s 13 -- but I don&#39;t know what you mean by saying &#34;really&#34; in the question.&#34;  No sense has been given to the question of the existence of numbers, over and above the sense that has been given by virtue of the meanings of mathematical terminology.  It&#39;s the job of techniques from &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; to clarify what can be said, and what cannot.  In this sense, Carnap is quite close to the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)&lt;/H3&gt;


The next entry on our tour simply &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be the inimitable LW.  Wittgenstein is an incredibly fertile philosopher: his work has inspired philosophers from all traditions.  His &lt;em&gt;Tractatus Logico Philosophicus&lt;/em&gt; (written in 1918, after Wittgenstein served in the Austrian army) is an enigmatic tract, which starts (in one translation) like this.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; The world is everything that is the case.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.1&lt;/b&gt; The world is the totality of facts, not of things.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.11&lt;/b&gt; The world is determined by the facts, and by these begin &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the facts.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.12&lt;/b&gt; For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.13&lt;/b&gt; The facts in logical space are the world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And it continues in this vein.  It is a work in &lt;em&gt;logical atomism&lt;/em&gt;, the doctrine that the world is made up of atomic facts, the primary bearers of information, and it motivates the logical techniques of truth tables and other interesting formal things as consequences of this picture.
&lt;p&gt;
Much more important for Wittgenstein was the boundary between the &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nonsense&lt;/em&gt;, or what could be &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; and what could not be said and what could only be &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt;.  The cosing words in the Tractatus are 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What is most interesting to me is that Wittgenstein explicitly 
acknowledges that his own book is, by his own lights, expressing what cannot be said.  The entire book is an act of &lt;em&gt;showing&lt;/em&gt; and not of &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt;.  It&#39;s a peculiar kind of showing, using German (or English) words, which the audience reads in the traditional manner.  (Wittgenstein himself was later unsatisfied with his own approach and he attempted to paint a very different picture about how language works.)
&lt;p&gt;
More information about Wittgenstein can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/553892&#34;&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
It is the mark of LW&#39;s distinction that he is the only person on this page to have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/~serge/wittgenstein/&#34;&gt;musical&lt;/em&gt; written about him.  Unfortunately, I have not seen it.  The Tractatus has also been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4269937,00.html&#34;&gt;set to music, more than once&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately, I have not heard any of it.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Skolem.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Skolem]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Thoralf Skolem (1887-1963)&lt;/H3&gt;



Thoralf Skolem was a Norwegian logician and mathematician who continued the development of set theory along the lines started by Cantor and Zermelo.  Skolem&#39;s name is associated with one of the most interesting results in metalogic (that is, it&#39;s a result &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; logic, not a result &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; logic), which we now call the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cheng.ececs.uc.edu/cs543/4-29.html&#34;&gt;Lowenheim Skolem Theorem&lt;/a&gt;.  This states that if a statement (or set of statements) in Frege&#39;s predicate logic can be satisfied by a model with infinitely many things in the domain, it can also be satisfied by a model with only &lt;em&gt;countably&lt;/em&gt; many things.  So, predicate logic, in an important sense, cannot tell the difference between the countably infinite and the uncountable infinite.
&lt;p&gt;
The most stunning and problematic consequence of this is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nd.edu/~tbays/professional/abstract.html&#34;&gt;Skolem&#39;s Paradox&lt;/a&gt;.  Take the theory of sets.  In this theory you can distinguish between countably infinite sets and uncountably infinite sets (a countably infinite set is one which can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the numbers {1,2,3,...}), and furthermore, you can prove that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; uncountably infinite sets (Cantor&#39;s construction can be carried out).  This theory, if it is consistent, has a model.  This model must be &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; (it contains elements for each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, at least!) so by the downward Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, it also has a countable model.  But what of the sets that the &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; takes to be uncountably infinite.  From &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the model, they are uncountable.  But from outside, we see that they are not.  What is the story?
&lt;p&gt;
Well, that&#39;s a real problem.  Skolem&#39;s enticing response was to say that the difference between the countable and the uncountable was &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt;.  Another response would be to say that the predicate logic theory of sets is incomplete, and it must be extended somehow.
&lt;p&gt;
Interesting information about Skolem and the application of his ideas can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hf.uio.no/filosofi/njpl/vol1no2/contents.html&#34;&gt;Nordic Journal of Philosophical Logic&#39;s special issue on Skolem&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Brouwer.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Brouwer]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;L. E. J. Brouwer (1881-1966)&lt;/H3&gt;


Brouwer was a Dutch mathematician who founded the school of &lt;em&gt;intuitionism&lt;/em&gt;, a radical tradition in mathematics.  Intuitionism is &lt;em&gt;radical&lt;/em&gt; because it takes much of contemporary mathematics to be simply mistaken, that mathematicians took a wrong turn when following Cantor&#39;s direction in set theory, and the classical tradition in analysis (the theory of real-valued functions).  Mathematics has gone bad when dealing with the &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;, because traditional mathematical practice does not do justice to what mathematics is actually &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;, according to Brouwer.
&lt;p&gt;
For Brouwer, mathematics is primarily governed by the &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt; of the knowing and proving &#34;mathematical subject&#34;.  Now, &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;gut instinct&#34; like it does in contemporary language.  The term is a piece of art looking back at least to Kant and his &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;.  Intuition, for Brouwer, just means a mental faculty.  The important features of the intuition relevant to mathematics is that they are &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; intuitions of space and time.  These intuitions aren&#39;t given by experience, but rather, they structure experience.  We put our experiences together in a &#34;manifold&#34; of moments and locations: we don&#39;t extrapolate the idea of time or space from our experiences (for Kant, and for Brouwer).  Anyway, the details are irrelevant for us, the fact that the mental ability to &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;, to go to the &lt;em&gt;next thing&lt;/em&gt;, an intuition of &lt;em&gt;duality&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;-ness is what is important in mathematics.  The content of mathematical judgement is not some correspondence with an external world of mathematical objects, but rather, the contents of mathematical judgements (like the claim that 2+2=4, or that the area of a circle is proportional to the square of the radius, or that real-valued functions which are somewhere positive and somewhere negative are also zero somewhere) are to be found in the possible &lt;em&gt;verifications&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;constructions&lt;/em&gt; involved.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, this approach is both conservative (it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Kantian&lt;/em&gt;, not the radical approach of logicism stemming from Frege and Russell) and radical.  It&#39;s radical because it motivates a rejection of traditional mathematical claims, like the law of the excluded middle --- the thesis that every proposition is either true or not true.  Brouwer takes this to be mistaken because of the nature of mathematical judgement and proof.  Consider this simple example: suppose I give you a series of numbers, one by one.  1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...  I ask you if this series converges to zero or doesn&#39;t.  If this series is truly &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; (I&#39;ll just keep giving you numbers as long as you keep asking for them) you&#39;ll never know if the series is converging to zero, or that it&#39;s not going to zero.  (If I just give you the numbers one-by-one, and I do not give you a &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt; which generates the list: there&#39;s always a chance the series will stop shrinking, and I go 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, ..., or that I start going up instead of going down.)   Browuer takes this to be a reason to reject the law of the excluded middle.  We oughtn&#39;t say that the series is converging or not. Once you make &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; change to mathematical practice, a lot else looks &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different.  Intuitionistic mathematics is alive and well to this day as a minority tradition.

&lt;H3&gt;Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)&lt;/H3&gt;



Bertrand Russell is the first &lt;em&gt;philosopher&lt;/em&gt; on this list from an English-speaking background, and he is probably best considered as the one person who played the crucial role in founding the Anglo/American analytic tradition in philosophy.
&lt;p&gt;
Russell&#39;s &lt;em&gt;magnum opus&lt;/em&gt; (written with Alfred North Whitehead) is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/052106791X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/a&gt; (don&#39;t buy the full thing unless you have lots of disposable wealth --- the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521626064/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;lite version&lt;/a&gt; is enough of the good stuff to give you the flavour of the work).  What&#39;s &lt;em&gt;PM&lt;/em&gt; all about?  It&#39;s the first and greatest attempt in the research programme of &lt;em&gt;logicism&lt;/em&gt;, the reduction of mathematics to logic.  Now, this is an immensely creative work, because it played a very important part in helping define the notion of &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; for the 20th Century.  As Alberto Coffa has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521447070/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;taught me&lt;/a&gt;, I know that logicism wasn&#39;t a matter of taking a predefined notion of &#34;logic&#34; and showing how mathematics could be reduced to it.  Rather, it was a matter of expanding the notion of logic so as to make a reduction of mathematics to logic more feasible.  In Kant&#39;s time, logic was a matter of the analysis of concepts into their constituents.  By the time Russell and Whitehead got their hands on it (after it had passed through the work of Frege) it became so much more.
&lt;p&gt;
One thing Russell can be thanked for, above and beyond PM, is a miniature example of logicism and analytic philosophy at work.  It&#39;s his little vignette on &lt;em&gt;definite descriptions&lt;/em&gt;, which stands to this day as a gem in analytic philosophy.  The analysis concerns the difference between claims like
&lt;blockquote&gt;
George Bush is articulate.&lt;p&gt;
The present U.S. President is articulate.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
They look like they have the same form.  In the old-style Aristotelian analysis, they&#39;re both of subject-predicate form, with the subject (George Bush, or the present U.S. President) on the one hand and the predicate &lt;em&gt;being articulate&lt;/em&gt; being applied to him.  But there is an important difference between these claims:  The first uses a &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; and the second uses a &lt;em&gt;description&lt;/em&gt;.  The description in the second claim is a &lt;em&gt;definite&lt;/em&gt; description because it refers to &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; present U.S. President, not simply &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; present U.S. President.  (That would be an &lt;em&gt;indefinite&lt;/em&gt; description.)  Definite descriptions seem to have a number of important properties.  For them to &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, for that claim &lt;em&gt;the present U.S. President is articulate&lt;/em&gt; to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, you need &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; critieria to be satisfied.  First, there needs to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a U.S. President --- if not, your claim fails because there&#39;s no U.S. President to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; articulate.  Second, there has to be at most &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; U.S. President.  If there are more than one, then it&#39;s unclear which I was talking about, and (according to Russell at least) my claim fails too.  Third, if there is exactly one U.S. President then my claim is true if and only if that person is, indeed, articulate.
&lt;p&gt;
So, to sum up the analysis, Russell says that a claim of the form &#34;the &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;&#34; is not really of subject-predicate form at its base.  Rather, it has the following form
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is a thing which is &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;, it is the &lt;em&gt;only F&lt;/em&gt;, and it is a &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; as well
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a typical example of an &#34;analysis&#34;, in analytic philosophy.  The surface form of an expression may be deceptive.  Different logical work may be involved in the claim, and you might need to expend effort to see what is actually being said.
&lt;p&gt;
Russell himself appears to have been rather confused about the significance of what he was doing.  Sometimes he described his work as replacing objects with logical constructions.  But this is not what&#39;s going on here.  The logical construction does not replace any object at all --- the present President of the U.S. is still a flesh and blood human being and not a &#34;construction&#34;.  The analysis and reduction occurs at the level of &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;.  The meaning of a definite description claim is reduced to being a construction of more primitive kinds of claims, involving predicates and quantification.  Analytic philosophy of this kind made the way open for a new kind of reductionism, which didn&#39;t explain away &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt; or construct them out of more simpler entities, but rather, it explains different kinds of &lt;em&gt;statements&lt;/em&gt; by giving their significance in terms of other, simpler statements.  You don&#39;t need to refer to special kinds of objects as the referents of definite descriptions, for example, if you have an analysis of definite descriptions which doesn&#39;t appeal to reference at all.

&lt;H3&gt;Jan Lukasiewicz (1878-1956)&lt;/H3&gt;



Lukasiewicz is the first &lt;em&gt;beardless&lt;/em&gt; logician on our journey, since Boole, and similarly, he&#39;s the first &lt;em&gt;algebraist&lt;/em&gt; since Boole too.  Lukasiewicz is important for many reasons.  For one, he was one of the leading lights on logic in Poland for many years (until his emigration to Ireland before the Second World War), responsible for the Logic group in Warsaw, along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Leshniewski.html&#34;&gt;Lesniewski&lt;/a&gt;, and Tarski (who we&#39;ll learn about later) was educated in this school. 
&lt;p&gt;
For another, though, Lukasiewicz was the first truly non-classical logician to gain a foothold for alternative views of logic.  The guiding principle behind both Boole&#39;s and Frege&#39;s approach to logic was the statements were either true or false.  Lukasiewicz investigated logical structures where this condition was violated.  In particular, he looked at three-valued logical systems which kept a way open for things which were undetermined.  After all, if our statements are about the future, then some might be made true by present facts, some might be made false by these circumstances, and some might neither be made true nor ruled out -- at least if the future is genuinely open.   Lukasiewicz&#39;s &#34;three-valued logic&#34; is one way of modelling such phenomena.  He also considered a more radical algebraic system where statements can have one of &lt;em&gt;infinitely many values&lt;/em&gt;, one for each number between 0 and 1, representing &lt;em&gt;degrees&lt;/em&gt; of truth between complete falsity and complete truth.  This has now reached some popularity under the name &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abo.fi/~rfuller/fuzs.html&#34;&gt;fuzzy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.austinlinks.com/Fuzzy/&#34;&gt;logic&lt;/a&gt;&#34;.  This just goes to show that if you want to be popular, you ought to get a marketer to run his or her eyes over the papers you write before you submit for publication.  &#34;Fuzzy logic&#34; will sell much better than &#34;Lukasiewicz&#39;s Infinely Valued Logic&#34;.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;Ernst Zermelo (1871-1953)&lt;/H3&gt;



Zermelo did for &lt;em&gt;set theory&lt;/em&gt;, the mathematical theory of collections or sets, what Dedekind and Peano did for arithmetic.  He was the first to have a bash at working out principles which governed the mathematical practice of set-formation.  The theory of sets mathematicians most often appeal to is a direct descendent of Zermelo&#39;s original work.  ZF set theory is named after Zermelo and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Beginnings_of_set_theory.html&#34;&gt;Fraenkel&lt;/a&gt; who revised and extended his work.

&lt;H3&gt;David Hilbert (1862-1943)&lt;/H3&gt;


David Hilbert not only had great style in headwear, he was pretty influential when it came to setting the agenda in mathematics and logic too.  He&#39;s famous for many of different things, including his work in real analysis (Hilbert spaces) and on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0875481647/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Foundations of Geometry&lt;/a&gt;, but he&#39;s most remembered for his 23 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/toc.html&#34;&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; he set the mathematical community at an international congress in 1900.  The &lt;em&gt;great moment&lt;/em&gt; for me in this work is the spirit in which the enterprise was offered to the community.  These new techniques of proof and rigour and clarity have helped us see these problems and issues anew.  These are clearly stated problem with answers to be found.  We have the technqiues to solve these problems in the affirmative or the negative.   For Hilbert, proof and consistency was at the heart of mathematical technique.  Proof, in clear logical steps, was the guarantee of truth.  Consistency (the absence of any contradictions or other clashes in your assumptions or axioms) is the guarantee of existence.  In both cases, logic is placed at the heart of the discipline of mathematics.  
&lt;p&gt;
Hilbert&#39;s scene setting was effective: the techniques of G&amp;ouml;del and Cohen used to give an answer to Hilbert&#39;s first problem on the cardinality of the collection of real numbers, and Gentzen&#39;s proof of the comsistency of arithmetic (dealing with Hilbert&#39;s second problem) both used new and fruitful logical techniques.  Not only was logic at the heart of mathematics in a way it never really had been before, but new logical techniques and results were being developed so that it could fill that role.  The place of logic in the heart of mainstream mathematical practice, and not merely in foundational studies, is in part, due to Hilbert&#39;s conception of the subject.
&lt;p&gt;
Here&#39;s information about Hilbert in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/494577&#34;&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Scientists&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Husserl.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Husserl]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Edmund Husserl (1859-1938)&lt;/H3&gt;


What?  Husserl wasn&#39;t a logician, he was a phenomenologist!  That&#39;s the cry of my dedicated analytic philosopher readers.  But a response like this is to presume that things in the turn of the 19th/20th Century looked to their inhabitants rather like &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; think they should, looking back from beyond the great divide between so-called-analytic and so-called-continental philosophy.  Husserl couldn&#39;t have conceived of such a division, and as far as I can tell, he&#39;s pretty much an &lt;em&gt;analytic&lt;/em&gt; philosopher along with Russell, Wittgenstein, and the rest of the gang.  (And hey, didn&#39;t Frege live on the continent?  And didn&#39;t half of the rest of them?  It&#39;s a crazy distinction, the analytic/continental one when you think of it.)
&lt;p&gt;
But why does Husserl warrant a place on my list of great moments in logic?  For two reasons.  The first is to mourn what might have been.  The so-called split which means that people interested in &lt;em&gt;phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; (a detailed analysis of phenomena, the structure of appearance, bracketing out questions of existence) can&#39;t talk to people interested in &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; is a very sad one.  Looking back to Husserl who was active before such a split occured makes me wistful for &lt;em&gt;what might have been&lt;/em&gt; and hopeful for &lt;em&gt;what could yet be&lt;/em&gt;.  Husserl, the great phenomenologist and the one who inspired Heidegger, Sartre and many others, was a student and assistant of the great mathematician Karl Weierstrass, and for fifteen years he was a colleague and close friend of Georg Cantor.  
&lt;p&gt;
But Husserl is important too for what he has achieved and what we can learn from him.  For Husserl, along with Frege and others helped get logic out of the quagmire of &lt;em&gt;psychologism&lt;/em&gt; (I&#39;m showing my cards here by the way I describe this, aren&#39;t I?).  You can see the confusion even in someone as great as Boole.  He calls the laws of logic the &lt;em&gt;Laws of Thought&lt;/em&gt;.  And that is confusing because it could mean at least two very different things.  Either you mean the laws governing how people reason (like laws of physics, which are intended to describe how objects move and interact) or the laws governing how people &lt;em&gt;ought to reason&lt;/em&gt;.  Only the latter kind of analysis gets the connection between logic and thought right, only it gives logic it&#39;s kind of &lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; edge, and only this gets the phenomena of teaching first-year logic correct.  (If logic is how people actually think, then why do so many of my students find logic hard to learn?)
Husserl&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Arithmetic&lt;/em&gt; explores this and related themes.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;06&#34;&gt;2001/11/06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Peano.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Peano]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932)&lt;/H3&gt;


Guiseppe Peano was an Italian mathematician, remembered for what are called &#39;Peano&#39;s Axioms&#39;, giving the properties of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,... and the operations of successor (going to the next number), addition and multiplication.  The axioms group into sections.  The first few govern zero and successor:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 0 is a number which is not the successor of any number
&lt;li&gt; every number has just one successor which is a number
&lt;li&gt; and that no two numbers have the same successor.
&lt;/ul&gt;
Then for &lt;em&gt;addition&lt;/em&gt; we have two axioms:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; x added to 0 is x.
&lt;li&gt; x added to the successor of y is the successor of (x added to y)
&lt;/ul&gt;
And for &lt;em&gt;multiplication&lt;/em&gt; we have two more axioms:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; x multiplied by 0 is 0
&lt;li&gt; x multiplied by the successor of y is (x multiplied by y) added to x
&lt;/ul&gt;
Both batches of axioms tell you how the operation works by showing how it works at the &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt; of the scale (how to add zero or multiply by zero), and then 
it shows you how to do it higher up the scale (adding the successor of a number, or multiplying by the successor of a number) in terms of how it works lower down the scale.  &lt;p&gt;
Let&#39;s see one example.  Here&#39;s how the axioms tell you what you get when you add 2 and 3.  2 is the successor of the successor of zero, so let&#39;s write that &#34;ss0&#34;, and 3 is the successor of the successor of the successor of zero, so let&#39;s write that &#34;sss0&#34;.  In general, if x is some number, let&#39;s write &#34;sx&#34; for the successor of x.  
&lt;p&gt;
So, to get ss0 + sss0, the rules say that this is the same number as s(ss0 + ss0), because we&#39;re adding sss0 (which is the successor of ss0) to ss0, so the result is the successor of the smaller addition (ss0+ss0).   Let&#39;s display this so that we can see it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ss0+sss0 = s(ss0+ss0)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Now, what&#39;s ss0 + ss0?  The process is the same: ss0+ss0 = s(ss0+s0).  The rules say
we can trade an &#34;s&#34; on the right of an addition sign in for one outside the whole addition.  So, we get
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ss0+sss0 = s(ss0+ss0) = ss(ss0+s0)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
But we can do this one more time.  ss0+s0 = s(ss0+0), so
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ss0+sss0 = s(ss0+ss0) = ss(ss0+s0) = sss(ss0+0)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
But now, we know that ss0 + 0 = ss0, since adding zero gets you &lt;em&gt;nowhere new&lt;/em&gt;.  So,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ss0+sss0 = s(ss0+ss0) = ss(ss0+s0) = sss(ss0+0)= sssss0
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
But sssss0 is how we write &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;, and indeed we&#39;ve shown that 2+3=5.
&lt;p&gt;
You can show lots more things with these axioms, but they don&#39;t do everything Peano wanted to think about.  In particular, for any numbers x and y at all, you can show that x + y = y + x.  However, with these axioms as they stand, you &lt;em&gt;can&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; show that for every number x and y, x + y = y + x.  Do you get the difference here?  The first says I&#39;ve got a proof for every instance.  The second says that I&#39;ve got a proof for the general rule.  That&#39;s a different thing completely.  To show that you&#39;ve got a proof for the general rule we need something to say that whatever we can prove for the instances of numbers we can pick (0, s0, ss0, etc) goes for all of the numbers.  A rule which does this is the rule of &lt;em&gt;induction&lt;/em&gt;.  
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If something holds of 0, and if whenever it holds of a number it also holds of the successor of that number, then it holds of all the numbers.
&lt;/ul&gt;
This rule assures us that we can prove statements about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the numbers, like the statement that the order of addition doesn&#39;t matter.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, proofs of facts using Peano&#39;s rules are &lt;em&gt;extremely longwinded&lt;/em&gt;, and you might be wondering what this is good for.  After all, I already &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that 2+3=5, and I think you did too.  Peano&#39;s rules don&#39;t explain what we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; when we count or add or multiply.  They&#39;re intened to distill to their essence the postulates which govern the counting, adding and multiplying process, even if they&#39;re not the rules we actually follow when we do things.  (There are many different ways of learning to multiply.  But if you don&#39;t agree with Peano&#39;s rules and get the same results as Peano does for his answers, then you&#39;re either making a mistake, or you&#39;re doing something other than counting.) Peano&#39;s work was essential in clarifying and codifying what counting, adding and multiplying actually involves, and it is another great moment in the work of logicians in the 19th and 20th Centuries.
&lt;p&gt;
 Peano&#39;s axioms for arithmetic weren&#39;t actually &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; invented by Peano: The great mathematician Dedekind was responsible for the axioms which Peano took up, clarified, detailed and explained, and it was through Peano that the work was disseminated to Russell and Whitehead and their magnificent &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt; which shaped a lot of work in the 20th Century.
&lt;p&gt;
I find it charming that Peano didn&#39;t just do lots of mathematics and logic.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/494994&#34;&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Scientists entry on Peano&lt;/a&gt; tells us that &#34;among his extramathematical interests he was a keen propagandist for a proposed international language, Interlingua, which he had developed from Volap&amp;uuml;k.&#34; Quaint.
&lt;p&gt;
Here&#39;s more on Peano from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=553105&#34;&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/494994&#34;&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Scientists&lt;/a&gt;.  The hard core among my readers might like to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/&#34;&gt;Richard Kaye&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019853213X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Models of Peano Arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;.


&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;05&#34;&gt;2001/11/05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Meinong.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Meinong]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Alexius Meinong (1853-1920)&lt;/H3&gt;



Frege&#39;s analysis of expressions helps deal with &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the weird confusions you can get into with language: when you know that a expressions like &#34;Socrates&#34;, &#34;somebody&#34;, &#34;everybody&#34; and &#34;nobody&#34; work very differently, you won&#39;t get so confused wondering whether the word &#34;somebody&#34; refers to a person, and if so, what kind of person he or she is (male, female, tall, short, logician, whatever).  No, you&#39;ll realise that terms like &#34;somebody&#34;, &#34;everybody&#34; and &#34;nobody&#34; don&#39;t contribute to expressions by &lt;em&gt;referring&lt;/em&gt; to things, but by doing something else: they &lt;em&gt;quantify&lt;/em&gt; over things.
&lt;p&gt;
Meinong agreed with all of that, but he thought that sometimes there are expressions which genuinely &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; refer to things, and what they refer to tells us something important about what there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.  He was one of those philosophers who thought that language, when properly understood, is a guide to &lt;em&gt;ontology&lt;/em&gt;.  One place where Meinong disagreed with many other philosophers was in the kind of ontology he was prepared to admit on the basis of language.  For Meinong, a claim like &#34;I&#39;m thinking of a golden mountain&#34; might be true, and it&#39;s true because there&#39;s something I&#39;m thinking of.  What is it I&#39;m thinking of?  It&#39;s a golden mountain.  So, there&#39;s a golden mountain that I&#39;m thinking about.  Now, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; there any golden mountains?  Do any of them &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;?  I don&#39;t think so.  It follows that (for Meinong) there are two grades of being.  There&#39;s the kind of being that absolutely everything has, golden mountains, square circles, fictional characters, tables, chairs, you and me.  And then there&#39;s the kind of being that fewer things have: &lt;em&gt;genuine existence&lt;/em&gt;.  You and I exist (that is, if you&#39;re not a fictional character reading this) but fictional characters, square circles and golden mountains don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;.  We can think &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; them, and they have some properties, says Meinong, but &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; is not one of them.
&lt;p&gt;
This is a bold claim, and it&#39;s easy to see why some people don&#39;t follow Meinong in this view.  Why should language guide ontology in this way?  (Of course, this is a general technique used by many analytic philosophers to this day.  &#34;For our speech about &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; to make any sense, we need to posit the existence of things such as &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;...&#34;)  But I think there&#39;s much more of a problem with the view as stated.  For Meinong, the golden mountain is golden, and it&#39;s a mountain, because that&#39;s how I&#39;ve characterised it.  But it doesn&#39;t exist (there aren&#39;t any golden mountains).  Now, what if I try to characterise the &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; golden mountain.  It&#39;s golden, it&#39;s a mountain, but does it &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;?  No.  So some ways of characterising things work, and others don&#39;t.  What&#39;s the difference?  It&#39;s a tricky question, and it&#39;s one that Meinong never really answered.
&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s an entry on Meinong in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/552771&#34;&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, and it&#39;s a real shame that both Karel Lambert&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521250854/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Meinong and the Principle of Independence&lt;/a&gt; and Richard Routley&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0909596360/&#34;&gt;Exploring Meinong&#39;s Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, the two best books on Meinong&#39;s ontology, are pretty hard to get.  You&#39;ll have to steal them from me, I suppose.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Frege.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Frege]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Gottlob Frege (1848-1925)&lt;/H3&gt;



Gottlob Frege is rightly called the &lt;em&gt;father of modern logic&lt;/em&gt;.  He helped set the tone and direction for the way we study logic to this day.  Like many people who made their mark in logic, by training he was a mathematician, but his interests were also philosophical.  He realised that the formal techniques of mathematics were good for representing things precisely, but that there were still many more gains to be made.  In particular he thought that languages like German (his native language) and English and any other language we actually speak, is filled with ambiguities, inconsistencies and features which lead us astray.  In particular, the similar structures of claims like
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Socrates is mortal.
&lt;li&gt; A human is mortal.  (Or &#34;Humans are mortal&#34;, if you prefer.)
&lt;li&gt; No-one is mortal.
&lt;/ul&gt;
lead us to think that the same kinds of things are being said in each case: we predicate mortality of Socrates, humanity and no-one in the three statements.  Frege thought this was simply crazy, and that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; structure of what you&#39;re saying in each case is rather different. In the first case, we indeed predicate mortality of the person Socrates.  In the second case we&#39;re not predicating &lt;em&gt;mortality&lt;/em&gt; of anything in particular (or anything in general).  According to Frege what we&#39;re doing is very different: we&#39;re saying that another statement is &lt;em&gt;universally satisfied&lt;/em&gt;.  What statement is this?  It&#39;s the statement &lt;em&gt;if x is human, x is mortal&lt;/em&gt;.  In saying that humans are mortal, I&#39;m saying that &lt;em&gt;if x is human, x is mortal&lt;/em&gt; is true for any &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; I choose.  Or more swiftly &lt;em&gt;for all x: if x is human, x is mortal&lt;/em&gt;.  And &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is nothing like the claim that Socrates is mortal.  It has a very different structure.
&lt;p&gt;
The claim that no-one is mortal has a similar feature. It says not that a particular thing (that is, &lt;em&gt;no-one&lt;/em&gt;) is mortal, but rather that the claim &lt;em&gt;x is someone who is mortal&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; satisfied.  If you like &lt;em&gt;for some x: x is someone who is mortal&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true.
&lt;p&gt;
Frege thought that this new way of analysing expressions gets closer to the real structure of the concepts involved.  The new way of writing expressions --- making the form you write closer to the forms the concepts actually have --- is Frege&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Begriffschrift&lt;/em&gt;, his &#34;Concept Script&#34;.  
This notation looks very weird (there&#39;s lots of lines going all over the place, and funny letters in different places) but it&#39;s almost identical in content to the language we now call First-Order Logic, or &lt;em&gt;Predicate Logic&lt;/em&gt;, and which we teach to our introductory logic students.  Frege&#39;s insights have stayed with us to this day.
&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s an entry on Frege in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/552123&#34;&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  You can get Anthony Kenny&#39;s clear introduction &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631222316/consequentlyorg/&#34;&gt;Frege&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon.  Both are worth reading.


&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;03&#34;&gt;2001/11/03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Cantor.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Cantor]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Georg Cantor (1845-1918)&lt;/H3&gt;


Georg Cantor conquered the &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;.  Well, maybe he didn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;conquer&lt;/em&gt; it, but at least gave us a new way of conceptualising infinite quantities, and this is an amazing feat however you look at it.  
&lt;p&gt;
Everyone agrees that some collections are infinite and some are not.  The collection {1,2,3} of the first three counting numbers is &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt;, it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt;.  But the collection {1,2,3,4,5,...} of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the counting numbers is not finite.  It&#39;s &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt;, it never comes to an end.   Cantor showed that this is not the end of the story at all.  He showed that there are &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; infinite numbers.
&lt;p&gt;
Hold on, you might say, how can things be bigger than &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;?  Isn&#39;t an infinite collection as big as you can get?  Cantor&#39;s answer is a surprising (qualified) &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;.  It&#39;s qualified because if by &#34;infinite&#34; you simply mean &#34;not finite&#34; then there&#39;s nothing bigger than &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;.  However, if you mean to say that there are no collections of things bigger than the collection {1,2,3,4,5,...} of all counting numbers, then Cantor can show that you&#39;re wrong.  But to do this, he needs to explain a little more about what we mean by &#34;bigger than&#34; and &#34;smaller than&#34; and &#34;same size as&#34; when it comes to collections.
&lt;p&gt;
This is pretty straightforward when it comes down to it.  Two collections are the &lt;em&gt;same size&lt;/em&gt; when you can correlate things from one collection with things from the other collection.  So, {1, 2, 3} is the same size as {Christine, Greg, Zachary}.  These collections have the same size as we can pair them up: Christine (1), Greg (2), Zachary (3).  
&lt;p&gt;
One collection is &lt;em&gt;at least as big as&lt;/em&gt; another collection if you can pair the things in the second up with things in the first, and maybe have things in the first collection left over.  So, for example {Christine, Greg, Zachary} is at least as big as {1,2} because we can pair up Christine (1), Zachary (2) and have me left over, uncounted.
&lt;p&gt;
One collection &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;smaller than&lt;/em&gt; another collection &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; just when &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not at least as big as &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;.  So, &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is smaller than &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; if there&#39;s no way of pairing things from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; with things from &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; with some things from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (possibly) left over.   We try to pair &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; things with &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; things, but we&#39;ve not got enough &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; things to go around to match up the &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; things.
&lt;p&gt;
This round-about-way of defining things is important, because Cantor wants to say that the collection {1,2,3,4,5,...} of all counting numbers is &lt;em&gt;the same size as&lt;/em&gt; {2,4,6,8,...} of all &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; numbers, even though the even numbers are inside the counting numbers with some left over.  You&#39;d think that this means that the even numbers are fewer in number than the counting numbers, but this contradicts our first definition that two collections are the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; size if they can be paired up.  We can pair up all the numbers with the even numbers like this:
1 with 2, 2 with 4, 3 with 6, ... &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; with 2 times &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
This is all good fun stuff (and it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;mind-bending&lt;/em&gt; when you &lt;a href=&#34;http://ubertas.infosys.utas.edu.au/mathemagicians_circle/table3.html&#34;&gt;think about what you can do with these infinite collections&lt;/a&gt;) but it&#39;s not even the start of Cantor&#39;s real discovery.  Cantor&#39;s best work was in showing that there had to be collections &lt;em&gt;bigger than&lt;/em&gt; the collection {1,2,3,...}.  This is a truly tricky piece of reasoning, but I think I can explain it.  Remember how you can represent &lt;em&gt;real numbers&lt;/em&gt; between 0 and 1 as &lt;em&gt;decimals&lt;/em&gt;, numbers like 0.5, or 0.32, or infinite repeating ones like 0.333333... (that&#39;s 1/3) or even infinite non-repeating ones like 0.14159... (that&#39;s pi minus 3).  Now Cantor showed that the collection of all real numbers between 0 and 1 is &lt;em&gt;truly bigger than&lt;/em&gt; the collection of counting numbers.  Here&#39;s how he did it.  He said, suppose that you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a list of all of these numbers: then this list would contain &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the numbers between 0 and 1.  It would look something like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0.12345145...
0.11111111...
0.34989901...
0.31415926...
0.88888888...
.
.
.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
but now, I&#39;ll show you a number that &lt;em&gt;can&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be on the list.  Take the first digit (after the 
decimal point) in the first number, the second in the second number, the third in the third number and so on.  You should be focussing on &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; digits
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0.&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;2345145...
0.1&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;111111...
0.34&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;89901...
0.314&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;5926...
0.8888&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;888...
.
.
.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, make a new number out of these digits, changing each one by adding one (and if a digit is 9, go back to zero).  So the number we get is
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0.22029...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; number could not be in our original list of numbers, because it is not the same as any number on the list.  (The &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;th number on the list differs from this number in the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;th place.)  So, the list you &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; was exhaustive, numbering all of the numbers, isn&#39;t.  
&lt;p&gt;
That is Cantor&#39;s &lt;em&gt;diagonalisation argument&lt;/em&gt;, and it&#39;s a truly creative piece of work, showing that there are different infinite sizes of collections.  The argument can be made more general, to show that for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; collection there is one bigger, and that&#39;s a mindboggling fact which we still haven&#39;t truly come to understand.  (If you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you understand it, ask yourself this: what happens when you apply it to the collection of &lt;em&gt;everything that there is&lt;/em&gt;?)

&lt;H3&gt;George Boole (1815-1864)&lt;/H3&gt;


Boole&#39;s book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486600289/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Laws of Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1854) is a landmark in the &lt;em&gt;algebraic&lt;/em&gt; treatment of logic.  That is, he showed how treating propositions or statements like &lt;em&gt;quantities&lt;/em&gt; results in a pleasing formal structure.  
&lt;p&gt;
The ideas are simple.  For every proposition &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; there is its negation (or denial) &lt;em&gt;~x&lt;/em&gt;.  The negation of a negation is the original statement (to deny &lt;em&gt;~x&lt;/em&gt; is to say no more or no less than &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) so &lt;em&gt;~~x&lt;/em&gt; is identical to &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.  Negation acts sort-of like minus with regards to numbers.  (Sort-of, anyway.)  Similarly, for statements &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; we can form their &lt;em&gt;conjunction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;x and y&lt;/em&gt; and their disjunction &lt;em&gt;x or y&lt;/em&gt;. (To make the algebraic connection clear, Boole used &lt;em&gt;xy&lt;/em&gt; for the conjunction of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;x+y&lt;/em&gt; for the disjunction of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;.)  Then &lt;em&gt;x or y&lt;/em&gt; is identical to &lt;em&gt;y or x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;x or (y and z)&lt;/em&gt; is identical to &lt;em&gt;(x or y) and (x or z)&lt;/em&gt;. This makes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; look a lot like multiplication and addition.  But the analogy is at most an analogy, because unlike the case with multiplication and addition &lt;em&gt;x and x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;x or x&lt;/em&gt; are just &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;~(x and y)&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;~x or ~y&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Boole characterised laws that he thought &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; systems of propositions must satisfy, and the resulting structures are called &lt;em&gt;Boolean Algebras&lt;/em&gt; in his honour.  They&#39;re important concepts to this day.
&lt;p&gt;
Here&#39;s more on Boole: Entries in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=551472&#34;&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=494061&#34;&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Scientists&lt;/a&gt;.  Then there&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486684830/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Boolean Algebra and its Applications&lt;/a&gt; showing some hints of where his research has gone today, and Boole&#39;s original book &lt;em&gt;Laws of Thought&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486600289/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;still available today&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/logicians/Bolzano.jpg&#34; width=&#34;108&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; alt=&#34;[Image of Bolzano]&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;Bernhard Bolzano (1781-1848)&lt;/H3&gt;


Bolzano was a philosopher, mathematician and logician who had important things to contribute in each of these fields.  He&#39;s probably &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; known for what he has done in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shu.edu/projects/reals/history/bolzano.html&#34;&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;: the precise definition of continuity when it comes to real-valued functions.  But for my money (and in my discipline) Bolzano was worth much more than this.  He was the first philosopher to give a precise &lt;em&gt;analysis&lt;/em&gt; of logical consequence in terms we would recognise today.  
&lt;p&gt;
(This was important for his project of understanding mathematics, and making it clearer, because mathematicians were getting into knots considering &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; numbers, &lt;em&gt;infinitesimal&lt;/em&gt; numbers, and many other seemingly paradoxical things.  The 1800s involved mathematicians painstakingly going over old reasoning step-by-step to see if (and how) the reasoning worked, and to see where it might go wrong.  You can really only do this if you have a good understanding of how reasoning works.  This is what Bolzano was trying to supply.)
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, he argued that you can tell that an argument from premises to a conclusion is logically &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; if and only if it never proceeds from truth to falsity no matter how you change the non-logical vocabulary in the argument.  So
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sally is coming to the party.&lt;br&gt;  If Sally is coming to the party, Jim will be happy. &lt;br&gt; Therefore Jim will be happy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
is &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; because we will never step from truth to falsity no matter how we change the subject matter.  For example
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sally is joining the army.&lt;br&gt;
If Sally is joining the army, she is putting her life at risk.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Therefore Sally is putting her life at risk.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
works too.  In fact any argument with the shape
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
works just as well.  Note that the closely related shape
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
doesn&#39;t work, and we can see that it doesn&#39;t work by looking at an example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it&#39;s Thursday then it&#39;s a weekday&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s a weekday&lt;br&gt;
Therefore it&#39;s Thursday
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This works &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; but not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time.  The premises are true but the conclusion is false on a &lt;em&gt;Friday&lt;/em&gt; for example.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, it&#39;s still very much an open question as to what you are allowed to change, and what you should keep fixed when you&#39;re testing an argument.  Bolzano is really interesting here, because he says that it&#39;s entirely a matter of convention.  Different rules will give you a different story when it comes to what&#39;s valid and what&#39;s not.  And that is pretty &lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com/&#34;&gt;appealing to me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, Bolzano&#39;s analysis of logical consequence is a great step in the direction of constructing modern formal logic.  We&#39;ll see more of where it leads soon.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;31&#34;&gt;2001/10/31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a change in store for you for next month.  Instead of ceaseless worry about Federal elections, asylum seekers or a war on terrorism, I bid you to enjoy some solace in abstraction.  For all of November, this site will be taken up with &lt;em&gt;Great Moments In Logic&lt;/em&gt;.  I hope to serve up one insight per day for thirty days, from thirty great philosopher/logicians.
&lt;p&gt;
(The alternative --- detailed reflection on the world around us --- is too much to bear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;30&#34;&gt;2001/10/30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in the theory of programming languages and related areas?  If so, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.ruu.nl/people/franka/ref.html&#34;&gt;this collection of resources&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start.  It&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.ruu.nl/people/franka/ref.html&#34;&gt;collection of online texts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;29&#34;&gt;2001/10/29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-29.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting thoughts can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nybooks.com/&#34;&gt;NYRB&lt;/a&gt;:  There&#39;s an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/14628&#34;&gt;article on the end of the Golden Age&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. tertiary education.  The thoughts apply more generally, and the author has interesting things to say about &lt;em&gt;relevance&lt;/em&gt;.  The catch-cry &lt;em&gt;be relevant&lt;/em&gt; is not necessarily something we philosophers must worry about: as the article says at the end, we need to search for how to &lt;em&gt;be relevant in a new way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;28&#34;&gt;2001/10/28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/ballot01/0110/28/ballot101.html&#34;&gt;Liberal Party Campaign Launch&lt;/a&gt; today: Margo Kingston&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/2001/10/28/FFXX3RNOBTC.html&#34;&gt;reactions&lt;/a&gt; seem on the money, and frightening.  One thing she doesn&#39;t mention is the implicit social engineering in the tax break for new parents.  The Liberal party offer is subtle, targeted, and very distressing.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/ballot01/0110/28/ballot101.html&#34;&gt;offer&lt;/a&gt; is for first-time parents to get a refund on the tax they paid in the year before the birth of their child.  For every five years &lt;em&gt;that one parent stays out of the workforce&lt;/em&gt; he or she will recieve a fifth of the tax he or she paid in the year before her child was born.
&lt;p&gt;
Let me explain why this is a &lt;em&gt;bad thing&lt;/em&gt;.  Of course supporting new families is a Good Thing (I can see this as a new father myself) but this way of doing it is multiply bad.  
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; First, it does nothing to encourage a balanced family life where both parents are involved in outside employment and both parents spend time at home looking after a child.  This is not the kind of family that the Howard government wishes to support.
&lt;li&gt; Second, it completely ignores the plight of single parents, who need to work and to raise a child.
&lt;li&gt; Third, it is regressive.  Mothers whose income pre-birth was below the tax-free threshold, despite needing support &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than richer mothers, receive a limited baseline payment.  If I earn significantly more, I get more back.  It in no way directs the money toward people who need it.  Instead, it is another way for more tax money to be taken out of the tax system where it can be used for social goods, and redistributed in an inequitable way.
&lt;/ul&gt;
Despite this, the tax-break will do the conservative parties &lt;em&gt;very well indeed&lt;/em&gt;.  If I were to stick my neck out, I&#39;d say that they&#39;ll win this election comfortably. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;27&#34;&gt;2001/10/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-27.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent a half hour or so poring over &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aec.gov.au/election2001/candidates/pdf/gvt/nsw.pdf&#34;&gt;this 280KB pdf file&lt;/a&gt; indicating who is assigning preferences where in the elections for Senators representing the glorious state of NSW.  Some striking facts emerged:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; My &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_03#07&#34;&gt;old acquaintance Ian Rintoul&lt;/a&gt; is running for the senate.  I don&#39;t fancy his chances of success.
&lt;li&gt; Plotting the likely preference flows between the &lt;em&gt;No GST&lt;/em&gt; party, the &lt;em&gt;Fishing&lt;/em&gt; Party, the &lt;em&gt;Lower Excise Fuel and Beer&lt;/em&gt; Party and ultimately &lt;em&gt;Pauline Hanson&#39;s One Nation&lt;/em&gt; is a tricky exercise.  Don&#39;t vote for any of them, please.
&lt;li&gt; I didn&#39;t know that Fred Nile&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Christian Democratic Party&lt;/em&gt; gave preferences to &lt;em&gt;Pauline Hanson&#39;s One Nation&lt;/em&gt;.  I had thought that his understanding of Christian morality was a bit more generous and less xenophobic than that.  Oh well.
&lt;/ul&gt;
Numbering 65 boxes is not easy.  I think this year I&#39;ll vote above the line.  At least now I can study where these preferences are going.  I think I&#39;ll be voting &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt;, but I&#39;m not sure yet.  Any advice from my readers?
&lt;p&gt;~&lt;p&gt;
Want to know what makes Martha Nussbaum run?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i06/06a01401.htm&#34;&gt;Now you know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;26&#34;&gt;2001/10/26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_10#16&#34;&gt;Ten days ago I mentioned our experiments in online shopping&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s time to report back to my loyal readers.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned from doing grocery shopping online.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Things arrive on time.  In our &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; orders so far from &lt;a href=&#34;http://colesonline.com.au/&#34;&gt;Colesonline.com.au&lt;/a&gt; they hit the mark on the 2 hour arrival window.  The first time they &lt;em&gt;only just&lt;/em&gt; arrived on time: the huge truck pulled up our street at 8:30pm on the dot, scraping into the 6:30 to 8:30 spectrum.
&lt;li&gt; The process is pretty labour intensive for the $13 service fee you pay.  There&#39;s someone to collect your items from the shelves of some Coles store or other, write comments on your order form if your selections are not available, more people to pack them into bags and barcode them, and the truck driver who takes at least 5 minutes to get everything off the truck and to your door and then to collect your money from your credit card.  
&lt;li&gt; They have two tricky loyalty-inducing devices.    First, the paperwork you get has a personal note (handwritten) from our &lt;em&gt;personal shopper&lt;/em&gt;.  Second, you get &lt;em&gt;free stuff&lt;/em&gt;.   On the first go, we got Radox body wash, an aroma-thingy for the bathroom and antibacterial wipes.  On the second go, we got a Colesonline.com.au mousepad (pity we have a powerbook and and ibook at home, with no mice to be seen), a Colesonline.com.au shopping list to be mounted on the fridge, and a paper towel dispenser.   So, as you can see, it&#39;s mostly &lt;em&gt;useless&lt;/em&gt; free stuff, presumably because it&#39;s mostly stock in excess in the shops.  It&#39;s a nice touch, and it lends an air of suprise to the unpacking.
&lt;li&gt; There&#39;s only been one discrepancy between what we paid for and what we got: We asked for two packets of teething rusks but we only got one.  A swift call to the free customer support line meant that we got the value of the rusks as a credit on the next order.  This is a swift solution, obviously to their advantage, as it means I shop with them again.  Still, there was no arguing and no attempt to get me to verify my claim.  I have no idea what they would do if I said that $50 of my order was missing, instead of $2.41.  
&lt;/ul&gt;
Altogether, it&#39;s been a happy experience thus far.  We&#39;ll be back for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;25&#34;&gt;2001/10/25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-25.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday night&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pr.mq.edu.au/mqmovies/&#34;&gt;Movies @ Macquarie&lt;/a&gt; was a lot of fun.  The crowd came up with lots of interesting points about &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;.  It was good to see that the discussion was less about the technicalities of time travel paradoxes (I was wondering how I could get across how I think is the best way to think about such crazy things) and more about the truly big issues in &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;: fate and freedom, the role of technology and science in the environment and on human society, and the way our dystopias are much more well-drawn than our ideas of heaven or utopia, which are generally thin and anemic.  In the case of &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;, the vision of blessed release and freedom is drawn from advertising.  James Cole is obsessed with the Florida Keys, which we only ever see mediated through television, radio and print advertising.
&lt;p&gt;
My co-conspiritor at the movies, David Macarthur, brought along his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0942299671/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; of the Chris Marker film &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cs.art.rmit.edu.au/projects/media/marker/La_Jetee_530.html&#34;&gt;La Jet&amp;eacute;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which was the inspiration for &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0942299671/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; is striking, partly due to incredible black and white images, and partly due to the simple narrative structure.  The book is nearly the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; film, because the film is made up of a series of still images, with narration and some music.   The images are subtle and thought provoking (especially in comparison to &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;p&gt;
But don&#39;t take my word for it.  You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/video/lajetee/&#34;&gt;see the film for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/vog/vlog/&#34;&gt;Adrian Miles&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rmit.edu.au/&#34;&gt;RMIT&lt;/a&gt; in Melbourne has digitised the film and made it available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a busy day today, with lots of filing and tidying occupying most of it.  I have managed, however, to install &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx&#34;&gt;Mac OS X 10.1&lt;/a&gt; on both the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powermaccube/&#34;&gt;cube&lt;/a&gt;, and on my Powerbook G3.  It&#39;s really nice, and works well.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;
Talking about things from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; which look really nice and work well, the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ipod&#34;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; (where do they get those names?) looks like the MP3 player to have.  I shudder to think of the price in Australia, though.  US$399 to carry around 5GB of music sounds kind-of OK to my ears, but translate that US$ into A$, and it&#39;s out of the question.

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/&#34;&gt;Zack&lt;/a&gt; and I went in to work together.  He was wonderfully patient with me when I dealt with postgraduat e student reviews.   They were interesting for me, but not so interesting, I suspect, for him!  He much preferred the potato, carrot and cottage cheese lunch, and the chance to play on his mat at lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;

Historical eras are never identical, but the similarities are provoking.

A counterpoint to this article is another by Edward Said, who points out that categories such as &lt;em&gt;Islam&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The West&lt;/em&gt; are not necessarily the most helpful ways to analyse contemporary events.  It&#39;s a helpful reminder that broad theses such as Huntington&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/clashofcivilizations.htm&#34;&gt;Clash of Civilisations&lt;/a&gt; are almost always necessarily crude and unhelpful.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... why not ... see parallels, admittedly less spectacular in their destructiveness, for Osama bin Laden and his followers in cults like the Branch Davidians or the disciples of the Rev. Jim Jones at Guyana or the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo? Even the normally sober British weekly The Economist, in its issue of September 22-28, can&#39;t resist reaching for the vast generalization, praising Huntington extravagantly for his &#34;cruel and sweeping, but nonetheless acute&#34; observations about Islam. &#34;Today,&#34; the journal says with unseemly solemnity, Huntington writes that &#34;the world&#39;s billion or so Muslims are &#39;convinced of the superiority of their culture, and obsessed with the inferiority of their power.&#39;&#34; Did he canvas 100 Indonesians, 200 Moroccans, 500 Egyptians and fifty Bosnians? Even if he did, what sort of sample is that? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thenation.com/docPrint.mhtml?i=20011022&amp;amp;s=said&#34;&gt;whole article&lt;/a&gt; for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s song: &lt;em&gt;If It All Comes True&lt;/em&gt;, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hcsd.com.au/warwick/chagall.html&#34;&gt;Chagall Guevara&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
As we walk the wire
across desperate times
will tomorrow find us
will you still be mine
will we hold our child
will he have a place
is there a hope for the human race?

If it all comes true
and our dreams fall like bombs from the blue
oh my love come stand by me&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It&#39;s been a while since I heard &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sockheaven.org/lyrics/53.html&#34;&gt;that song&lt;/a&gt;.  It sounds different now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;17&#34;&gt;2001/10/17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-17.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;16&#34;&gt;2001/10/16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a full-time worker and parent, and being married to another full-time worker and parent, we&#39;ve been exploring the wonderful worlds of online grocery shopping.  Here are a couple of observations for potential members of the online shopping public in Sydney or Melbourne.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It is impossible, using any of the big four shopping services (that&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greengrocer.com.au/&#34;&gt;Greengrocer.com.au&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shopfast.com.au/&#34;&gt;Shopfast.com.au&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.colesonline.com.au/&#34;&gt;Colesonline.com.au&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolworths.com.au/&#34;&gt;Woolworths.com.au&lt;/a&gt;), to buy toothbrushes by &lt;em&gt;colour&lt;/em&gt;.  This is a necessity in our household, where we use colour to identify your toothbrush.  I&#39;ll buy my toothbrushes &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iga.net.au/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=SEARCHDETAILS&amp;amp;id=2804&#34;&gt;locally&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; There&#39;s a big difference between prices, especially for fruit and vegetables.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greengrocer.com.au/&#34;&gt;Greengrocer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shopfast.com.au/&#34;&gt;Shopfast&lt;/a&gt; go the gourmet route, and have what they advertise as high quality, produce, with prices to match.  It was a surprise to me that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.colesonline.com.au/&#34;&gt;Coles&lt;/a&gt; was significantly cheaper than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolworths.com.au/&#34;&gt;Woolworths&lt;/a&gt; for fruit and vegies.  They were similar when it came to other groceries.  However, for fresh produce it is best to shop around and get what things you know to be of acceptable quality.
&lt;li&gt; There&#39;s also a big difference between the design of each online shopfront.  I didn&#39;t spend equal times at each of them, but it was obvious that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greengrocer.com.au/&#34;&gt;Greengrocer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolworths.com.au/&#34;&gt;Woolworths&lt;/a&gt; spent more time thinking about the &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; of their sites than the other players.  They have consistent branding and the pages as you shop just &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; high quality.  It&#39;s a pity, then, that they&#39;re slow loading, difficult to navigate, and (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolworths.com.au/&#34;&gt;Woolworths&lt;/a&gt;, especially) seem to have put little thought in to the interaction design.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.colesonline.com.au/&#34;&gt;Colesonline.com.au&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, looks like a dog&#39;s breakfast, with no consistent design elements.  However, comparatively at least, it&#39;s a breeze to actually use.  Finding things is relatively straightforward, and the continuously viewable and modifiable shopping cart is exactly what you want when collecting together a large basket of goods. 
&lt;/ul&gt;
I might let you know more, when our order arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;15&#34;&gt;2001/10/15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-15.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent observation, of my 6 months or so of giving &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/&#34;&gt;Zachary&lt;/a&gt; his bath.  Despite his being a baby, I&#39;ve never found myself doing anything remotely approaching throwing him out with the bathwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;13&#34;&gt;2001/10/13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-13.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s play &lt;em&gt;spot the bleeding-heart leftie&lt;/em&gt;.  Who said &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The widening gap between the rich and the poor in this country is impossible to ignore. Ours is what social scientists call an &#34;hourglass&#34; society, marked by the declining proportion of the middle class and the increasing polarization of upper and lower income levels. The richest one percent of Australian households own more than 15 percent of Australia&#39;s wealth. 
&lt;p&gt;
In 1999, the most affluent 20 percent of Australia&#39;s households earned more than ten times the annual income of the bottom 20 percent - and those figures have since drifted farther apart. The average income in Sydney is nearly A$600 per week; even in the most active of our regional towns like Dubbo and Armidale, it&#39;s less than half as much. Only around 17 percent of our Indigenous population takes part in higher education - half the rate of Australia&#39;s students overall - while Aboriginals in Western Australia and throughout the country are grossly over-represented in our states&#39; prison systems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Don&#39;t know?  Look &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/2001/10/12/FFXOIDSVOSC.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of his speech.  
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s not exactly what I&#39;d expected from one of the righest men in the world, but I suppose he knows the source of his wealth, and he&#39;s keen to make sure it&#39;s sustainable.  Hyper wealth might not last if the society upon which it&#39;s dependent crumbles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;12&#34;&gt;2001/10/12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.wins.uva.nl/~anne/&#34;&gt;Prof A. N. Troelstra&lt;/a&gt; has retired from the University of Amsterdam.  He&#39;s a very famous logician: an intuitionist and proof theorist.  (I think for a minute of what that sounds like to someone who doesn&#39;t have much exposure to the jargon of 20th Century Logic.  It doesn&#39;t mean what you think it might mean, but what it does mean is not of great import right now.)  Troelstra&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://turing.wins.uva.nl/~anne/looking.html&#34;&gt;Looking Back&lt;/a&gt;, his reflections on his time in Amsterdam, interest me.  Here are Two extracts: First, on what to do with mathematical cranks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
After my final examination in 1964, I became a mathematics instructor, which meant that I had to teach students in their first or second year how to de exercises in Analysis, Linear Algebra etc. The teaching was a, not unpleasant, routine; but now and then a task a little out of the ordinary came along. At one time there was a little epidemic of ‘trisectionists’, people who believed they had found a construction to divide an angle into three equal parts by means of ruler and compasses only. Mathematicians know that this is impossible; but some amateurs do not. It fell to my lot to answer their letters. When the second letter arrived, I decided to compose a standard answer, which ran as follows: ``Dear Sir, I checked your solution and found it to be entirely correct. In fact, already years ago I found a solution myself, but did not dare to publish it because of the jealousy and the stubbornness of my fellow-mathematicians. Therefore I advise you to do like me, and keep quiet. Yours etc.&#39;&#39; But when the third trisectionist came along, I could not use it, because he came in person, sent on by the Amsterdam tourist office. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, on the elements of academic training which provide lasting value (oh, and a little reference to Kreisel&#39;s womanising repoutation)
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
My host at Stanford had a deserved reputation as a top logician, and also, perhaps undeserved, as a womaniser. When I came to his office for the first time, he talked for a long time, and I was thankful for my previous training in looking intelligent while not understanding. From the corner of my eye I scanned some booktitles on a shelf; one title was ‘Seduction’. Afterwards I understood it had been ‘Deduction’, and since then I never needed convincing that our perceptions are influenced by our expectations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;11&#34;&gt;2001/10/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-11.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s what &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/11284&#34;&gt;everyone else is talking about too&lt;/a&gt;, but I cannot help link this here for my own readers.  Take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tctubantia.nl/CDA/regioportal/1,2078,1654__772741_,00.html&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/nm/20011005/wl/imdf05102001094431a.html&#34;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; of posters of Osama bin Laden.  See anything weird in them?  My theory is this: a Bangladeshi poster designer has a sense of humour and used images from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm&#34;&gt;Bert is Evil&lt;/a&gt; site.  (The Bert &amp;amp; bin Laden picture is no longer on the site but can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocities.com/freethoughtmecca/disney.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)

Do you like movies?  Do you like talking with people with ideas?  Do you live in Sydney?  If so, come to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pr.mq.edu.au/mqmovies/&#34;&gt;Movies at Macquarie&lt;/a&gt; and talk through the issues raised in movies with academics with a sense of humour.  On Sunday October 21, at 8pm, I&#39;ll be there talking about time travel in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pr.mq.edu.au/mqmovies/monkeys.htm&#34;&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
Happy 6 months, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/&#34;&gt;Zachary&lt;/a&gt;!  It&#39;s been one incredible half year.  Here&#39;s to many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;10&#34;&gt;2001/10/10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday night, after a gruelling day of sitting through job talks in our department, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/jsutton/&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; gave me a ride home. (An aside: the job market in Philosophy in Australia is &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt;.  We have a number of eminently suitable candidates for our jobs.  Choosing between them is tough.  Especially for me, knowing how and when I should contribute to the discussion, since I&#39;m leaving here in less than a year&#39;s time.  But this is a digression.) 
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, John and I were talking about the Current State of the World, and about &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archive/2001/10/03&#34;&gt;some of what I&#39;d written before&lt;/a&gt;: specifically in the relationship between religion and terrorism.  We both agreed that a particular sort of metaphysical belief was required for this kind of suicidal terrorist attack.  But the required belief is &lt;em&gt;not necessarily&lt;/em&gt; one of personal survival after death, despite the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/wtccrash/story/0,1300,552388,00.html&#34;&gt;intemperate comments of Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; which motivated some of my thought in the first place.  After all, many people have given their lives in war without thinking that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; would survive into some better place.  They thought that their &lt;em&gt;Cause&lt;/em&gt; was furthered in some way.  (Their family, their homeland, their political system, Truth, Justice, The American Way or whatever else.)  If a &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; is required to make such suicidal action reasonable, a post-mortem reward for the person giving their lives is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way to do it, but there are others.  If the person identifies with a &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; and that cause is furthered by the action, that might motivate suicidal action too.  Reasons are complicated things.
&lt;p&gt;
Talk of &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; doesn&#39;t exhaust the list of possible causes for actions like these.  People might be socialised or influenced into behaviour without having reasons for it at all.  Untangling the mix of reasons and causes is even more complicated.  I don&#39;t dare pontificate about all of what is actually involved in bringing about terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;09&#34;&gt;2001/10/09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-09.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, knowing that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,47319,00.html&#34;&gt;the U.S. has a large arsenal of &#34;tactical nuclear weapons&#34; just right for destroying underground bunkers&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t give me a great deal of confidence for global stability.  (Apparently, my opinion is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brook.edu/FP/PROJECTS/NUCWCOST/lasg.htm&#34;&gt;shared by experts&lt;/a&gt;.)  The use of nuclear weapons has immense symbolic significance, and surely everyone (including U.S. military planners) must know this.  The question remains: will those with the weapons think that the symbol is an appropriate one?  If so, then what will other groups think of the symbolism of nuclear weapons?

A tip: If you ever want to catch up with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/&#34;&gt;CNN website&lt;/a&gt;, don&#39;t browse the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;, try the &lt;a href=&#34;http://robots.cnn.com/&#34;&gt;one set up for &lt;em&gt;robots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Since robots don&#39;t buy anything, they thoughtfully strip the ads from the version they encourage robots to read.  You can be a robot too, now that you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;06&#34;&gt;2001/10/06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two quotes from Randall Collins&#39; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674001877/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Sociology of Philosophies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which has been very helpful in my thinking on how philosophy works, especially in the case of philosophy of religion (which I&#39;m teaching this semester) and philosophical logic (which is my major research interest).  First, on what it is to be a successful philosophy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A successful philosophy -- and a successful religion -- formulates an entire problem space, not just a solution.  (page 205)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That sounds right to me.  Successful philosophical positions structure problem spaces, they change the way we look at our world, and how we (philosophers, at least) look at philosophy itself.  I learned something when he applied thi truth to the analysis of philosophy of religion.  In this current pluralistic society, my students think that the &#34;proofs of the existence of God&#34; are best viewed as attempts to convince unbelievers of God&#39;s existence.  When you see philosophical activity in its intellectual context, you can see that this isn&#39;t the only goal.  Philosophers considering religion were sharpening their conception of &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;, they were constructing philosophical techniques, and they were tracing interconnections between concepts.  All of these insights are important today even for my students who don&#39;t think the arguments are convincing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is distinctive of the Western religions, not the Eastern, that philosophers devoted much effort to proofs of the existence of God.  Such proofs from a religious viewpoint are superfluous; the philosophers were not free in any case to consider whether God does not really exist.  The justification was sometimes offered that proofs were needed in order to convince unbelievers or convert members of other faiths, but this seems a patent rationalisation: Christians, Muslims and Jews could not convert one another by proving the existence of God, since all three faiths admitted this, and the differentiating items of faith were not proved in this fashion; and atheist unbelievers were an imaginary foil under these authoritarian regimes.  The philosophers&#39; construction of proofs for items of faith was a matter of creating a turf for pure intellectual activity within the institutional space of the religious schools.  These proofs became grounds on which metaphysical and epistemological doctrines could be worked out.  With a sufficiently complex network of philosophers, such as arose in Christendom by the late 1200s, it was no longer a foregone conclusion that one would have to succeed in proving the existence of God or the immortal soul.  By the time of Ockham and his followers, it was acceptable to conclude that these items could not be conclusively proved by reason; this was taken as demonstrating the superior power of faith, and also of demarcating the territory of distinctively philosophical techniques.

There&#39;s lots more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674001877/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;where these came from&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If (and only if) you&#39;re Australian, please read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/2001/10/05/FFXSDZACFSC.html&#34;&gt;Flying pig topples press club right wing&lt;/a&gt; Jack Robertson&#39;s tale of a National Press Club meeting which could only happen in a delightful Australia in some possible world remote from here.  One excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
With the latest Newspoll showing that 99.9% of voters `strongly agreed&#39; that `All pollsters are irrelevant nobheads&#39;, Gary Morgan announced that his colleagues would conduct no surveys during the campaign. 
&lt;p&gt;
&#34;We feel bad about distorting the democratic process for financial gain,&#34; he declared humbly. &#34;Frankly, no survey can possibly decipher the complex impulses driving voters.&#34; Asked about the impact of the New New Journalism on financial issues, a spokesman from Access Economics declined to comment, ever again. &#34;Economists are the worst people to ask about money matters, anyway,&#34; noted Terry McCrann. &#34;We&#39;re so buggered by conflicts of interest that our greatest contribution to this campaign will be to just shut up,&#39;&#39; he said.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/2001/10/05/FFXSDZACFSC.html&#34;&gt;much more where that came from&lt;/a&gt;.  A knowledge of the political media landscape in Australia will help you get the jokes, but there should be enough for you to understand even if you&#39;re not up with what&#39;s happening around here.

Just to confirm that Zachary doesn&#39;t like &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; we put in front of him, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/pumpkin/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is Zachary reacting to the delicious pumpkin/yoghurt mix in the evening.  It was not quite so &#34;yum&#34;, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;04&#34;&gt;2001/10/04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something much lighter for today.  Take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/avocado/&#34;&gt;Zachary eating avocado and yoghurt&lt;/a&gt;.  Yesterday&#39;s lunch.  Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;03&#34;&gt;2001/10/03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-03.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.speedysnail.com/walkingwest/4/2001_09_archive.html#29&#34;&gt;Rory&lt;/a&gt;, I have yet &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330375458/&#34;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; item to add to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1BCBQOXGSX906&#34;&gt;list of things to get around to reading one day&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jonronson.com/&#34;&gt;Jon Ronson&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330375458/&#34;&gt;Them: Adventures with Extremists&lt;/a&gt; sounds like just the thing I ought to read.
&lt;p&gt;
Why?  Because I want to get my thoughts straighter about a bundle of ideas in the aether at present.  I am uncomfortable with the rhetoric around &lt;em&gt;fundamentalism&lt;/em&gt; at the moment.  There&#39;s no doubt that there is a clash of ideas between western liberalism and different political and religious ideologies.  However, I don&#39;t think that &lt;em&gt;fundamentalism&lt;/em&gt; is the right term to pick out what distinguishes the terrorists from their targets and their enemies.  Of course, the Islamic Jihad is committed to a number of fundamental religious beliefs.  So are the pacifist Amish and Mennonite communities in the United States.  So are pacifist Buddhist communities in Asia.  I too am committed to a number of fundamental religious beliefs.  What distinguishes &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; fundamentalist beliefs is their expression in political engagement.  It is not only that they see the world in a very different way to others -- we all do that, surely -- I see the world, as a Christian, in a very different way to my friends, colleagues and students who are agnostics, Buddhists, Christians, irreligious atheists, Jews and Muslims, all of different stripes.  The difference is not one of religious commitment but instead, how this commitment is expressed in action.
&lt;p&gt;
I can see no direct link between the fact being committed to religious belief and violent action.  I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see connections between particular religious beliefs and particular violent actions.  But the causal factors seem to be varied: social, political, economic, cultural and historical factors all play a part, along with religious ideology, in violent clashes in this world.  
&lt;p&gt;
Jon Ronson&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330375458/&#34;&gt;Them&lt;/a&gt; sounds like a good read which will provoke more thought here.  Not about violence and its causes, but about &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; beliefs and &lt;em&gt;fringe&lt;/em&gt; cultures.  Seeing how and why some of these lead to violence (and some do not) should be more grist for the mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;02&#34;&gt;2001/10/02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One distinctive feature of the present conditions of Western society, I think, is the fact that whether you have children or not is an &lt;em&gt;issue&lt;/em&gt;.  It is a decision that people (primarily women, of course) consciously make, and the fact &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99aug/9908popdrop.htm&#34;&gt;seems to be&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0106/25/features/features5.html&#34;&gt;many are deciding not to have children&lt;/a&gt;, or only have one.  In many societies other than ours, this is not a question that is often asked.  Child-rearing is something you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, like eating, breathing, working, sleeping, talking, making friends and all of the other threads of the fabric of life.  It&#39;s not an option to be considered and possibly accepted or rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is salient for me, because I sometimes wonder about the decision that Christine and I made, to have a child.  We have our reasons, some easy to articulate, and others not so easy.  One thing that has struck me recently, is this.  Children teach you what it is to be human.  I&#39;m a philosopher: When I first think of what&#39;s important, I immediately think in terms of what you can &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;.  Actually, I&#39;m also a mathematician, and I understand that when you want to understand how something behaves, you examine it at its &lt;em&gt;boundaries&lt;/em&gt;, you look at its &lt;em&gt;limits&lt;/em&gt;.  Birth and death, and infancy and impending death have a great deal to teach us about what it is to live.  In the months we&#39;ve spent helping a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/&#34;&gt;young boy&lt;/a&gt; find his way in the world, we&#39;ve seen the beginnings of a human life, and we&#39;ve learned more about what it is to be human: to need to be cared for and supported, to be radically contingent on others, to enjoy laughter and to need rest.  People are incredible creatures.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;2001/10/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-10-01.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s entry comes our way via &lt;a href=&#34;http://logica.rug.ac.be/~joao/&#34;&gt;Joao Marcos&lt;/a&gt;, a logician now in Belgium, who I met in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/esslli/&#34;&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; in August.
&lt;p&gt;
This is a poem by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carlosdrummond.com.br/&#34;&gt;Carlos Drummond de Andrade&lt;/a&gt; (1902-1987), seen by many
as the best Brazilian poet ever (or at least from the 20th Century).  What
follows is Joao&#39;s tentative translation of it.
&lt;pre&gt;
ELEGY 1938

Workest joylessly for the ephemeral world,
where forms and actions hold no example.
Exercisest laboriously the universal gestures,
feelst warmth and coldness, lack of money, hunger and sexual desire.

Heroes flood the city parks in which thou dost wade
and they praise virtue, abnegation, temper, conception.
At night, in case of haze, they open coppered umbrellas.
Or they shelter into the volumes of sinister libraries.

Thou lovest the night for the annihilation power it holdeth
and knowest that, sleeping, the problems dispenseth thee of dying.
But the terrible awakening proveth the existence of the Great Machine
and doth put thee, minuscule, faced to undecipherable palm trees.

Walkest among deads and talkest with them
about things of the future time and businesses of the spirit.
Literature hath spoiled thy best hours of love.
In the telephone hast lost a lot, a real lot of sowing time.

Proud heart, hurriest to confess thy defeat
and to postpone to another century the collective happiness.
Acceptest rain, war, unemployment and unfair distribution
since thou canst not, alone, dynamite the island of Manhattan.

(Carlos Drummond de Andrade, &amp;#8220;Sentiment of the world&amp;#8221; 1940)
&lt;/pre&gt;
For your comparison, here is the original.
&lt;pre&gt;
ELEGIA 1938

Trabalhas sem alegria para o mundo caduco,
onde as formas e as a&amp;ccedil;&amp;otilde;es n&amp;atilde;o encerram nenhum exemplo.
Praticas laboriosamente os gestos universais,
sentes calor e frio, falta de dinheiro, fome e desejo sexual.

Her&amp;oacute;is enchem os parques da cidade em que te arrastas
e preconizam a virtude, a ren&amp;uacute;ncia, o sangue-frio, a concep&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o.
&amp;Agrave; noite, se neblina, abrem guarda-chuvas de bronze.
Ou se recolhem aos volumes de sinistras bibliotecas.

Amas a noite pelo poder de aniquilamento que encerra
e sabes que, dormindo, os problemas te dispensam de morrer.
Mas o terr&amp;iacute;vel despertar prova a exist&amp;ecirc;ncia da Grande M&amp;aacute;quina
e te rep&amp;otilde;e, pequenino, em face de indecifr&amp;aacute;veis palmeiras.

Caminhas entre mortos e com eles conversas
sobre coisas do tempo futuro e neg&amp;oacute;cios do esp&amp;iacute;rito.
A literatura estragou tuas melhores horas de amor.
Ao telefone perdeste muito, muit&amp;iacute;ssimo tempo de semear.

Cora&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o orgulhoso, tens pressa de confessar tua derrota
e adiar para outro s&amp;eacute;culo a felicidade coletiva.
Aceitas a chuva, a guerra, o desemprego e a injusta distribui&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o
porque n&amp;atilde;o podes, sozinho, dinamitar a ilha de Manhattan. 

(Carlos Drummond de Andrade, &amp;#8220;Sentimento do mundo&amp;#8221; 1940)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;28&#34;&gt;2001/09/28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-09-28.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/specials/natl/ballot01/index.html&#34;&gt;Ballot &#39;01&lt;/a&gt;:  With the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0109/28/national/national106.html&#34;&gt;CHOGM postponed&lt;/a&gt;, we&#39;ll almost certainly have an early federal election.  It&#39;s going to be messy, with the &#34;war&#34; on terrorism, the collapse and possible resurrection of Ansett, and asylum seekers all as hot issues here.  The polls give the conservatives a huge lead.  Let&#39;s see how this short election campaign plays out.  Interesting comment and analysis, as ever, will be found on the SMH &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/&#34;&gt;webdiary&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;~&lt;p&gt;
The thought for today comes from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~belnap/&#34;&gt;Nuel Belnap&lt;/a&gt; (specifically, from his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~belnap/phil1500/syllabus.html&#34;&gt;syllabus for PHIL1500&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;p&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Everyone should join a study group. The great ideal provided by the Vienna Circle should live: Although a lonely genius can be a marvelous sloppy thinker, rigorous thinking is done best in public.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;27&#34;&gt;2001/09/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wonder how a satirical magazine like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theonion.com/&#34;&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt; might respond to the Current Situation.  Wisely, they took a week&#39;s hiatus.  Even more wisely, they responded with satire like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theonion.com/onion3734/god_clarifies_dont_kill.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  You get theological insight in the strangest of places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;25&#34;&gt;2001/09/25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a person of such little faith!  Upon reading in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/&#34;&gt;Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s joke page yesterday of the National Public Toilet Map, I doubted their veracity!  I had no idea of the detailed glories to be found.  Indeed, hard at work on the National Continence Strategy, our Federal Government have produced an internet resource to rival all others.  Australia&#39;s very own, glorious &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.toiletmap.gov.au/&#34;&gt;National Public Toilet Map&lt;/a&gt;.  When you have to go, when you&#39;re on the move, this is the one bookmark you&#39;ll be glad you&#39;ve kept.&lt;/p&gt;

It is part of a series of comments from academics, published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/&#34;&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;.  It provokes this question for myself: what distinctive contribution might a &lt;em&gt;philosopher&lt;/em&gt; make to public discussion at this time?
&lt;p&gt;
Also today, the first of a series of photographs taken on a most enjoyable harbour cruise, last Saturday, with Christine and Zack and friends from Japan.  It was a glorious spring day, and the photos serve as a reminder of the splendour of Sydney and its harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More experiments with my playlist.  29 of the 740 tracks on my computer at work feature &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; in the title.  2 hours, 17 minutes and 29 seconds worth, 156.8 Megabytes of very different sentiments.

Somewhat surprising to me is the fact that the &lt;em&gt;pop&lt;/em&gt; brigade are completely outclassed here by the 16th/17th Century lutenist John Dowland, with 4 entries in the list, and the jazz piano of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/artists/47.html&#34;&gt;Keith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~lnewton/music/JarrettSketch.html&#34;&gt;Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; who rockets to the top of the charts with &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; of the 29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;21&#34;&gt;2001/09/21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-09-21.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point on yesterday&#39;s topic of electronic publishing.  The fact that I can access &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/&#34;&gt;Allen Hatcher&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; textbook on algebraic topology &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI&#34;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; makes it the first place &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; search for an intro to the field.  The freaky thing is this: he&#39;s convinced hid publisher, &lt;a href=&#34;http://uk.cambridge.org/&#34;&gt;Cambridge University Press&lt;/a&gt; to let him continue to freely distribute the electronic version, after they publish the hardcopy.  That&#39;s a coup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;20&#34;&gt;2001/09/20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/&#34;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/&#34;&gt;debate on electronic access of research results&lt;/a&gt;.  Electronic publishing and scholarly discourse can interact and influence one another in any number of ways.  I hope that however things shake out in the next decades, there&#39;s more widespread access to scholarly material (especially in the non-Western world, where access is limited by scarce resources) and we form the tools and techniques (both technological and social) for healthy discussion and communication.  It&#39;s hard to see how a lock-down on the &#34;industry&#34; by a small number of publishers aids these goals.
&lt;p&gt;
An interesting piece of information on this point: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/Articles/lawrence.html&#34;&gt;Free online availability substantially increases a paper&#39;s impact&lt;/a&gt;.   That&#39;s why you can access my stuff &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

From 28 seconds after midnight, this site got a request of the form
&lt;blockquote&gt;
GET /scripts/root.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0

(which looks to me like a request designed to try to exploit some weakness in some Windows webserver) from another machine on the Macquarie network.  Then a few more requests from the same server, obviously trying to do something tricky.  From then on, I&#39;m hit with at least five attacks per hour, mostly from other servers on the same local network, but also from other places.  No wonder the net has ground to a halt.
&lt;p&gt;
An email from &lt;a href=&#34;http://commons.somewhere.com/rre/&#34;&gt;Phil Agre&lt;/a&gt; gives a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,5097089,00.html&#34;&gt;pointer to an article about it&lt;/a&gt;, but I can&#39;t access that site at the moment.  Oh well.  It&#39;s just as well I&#39;ve got classes to teach, instead of research on the &#39;net to do today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/0109/19/A62647-2001Sep18.html&#34;&gt;very interesting analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the current crisis from Margo Kingston posted on her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/&#34;&gt;webdiary&lt;/a&gt; (which is a very important piece of journalistic experiment, by the way, which could be helped a little by some elementary web design expertise thrown at it to help readers see who wrote what, but I digress...).  This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/0109/19/A62647-2001Sep18.html&#34;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; is from an Australian in Germany, who understands well both the feeling of dread we westerners get from the events just passed, and what we might do about it.  Go, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/0109/19/A62647-2001Sep18.html&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday afternoon, I went to one of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petersham.bcnsw.net.au/&#34;&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s art workshops.  The theme for that day, &lt;em&gt;contrast&lt;/em&gt;.  My charcoal technique is &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; (maybe that&#39;s understandable, because the last time I used charcoal was over 20 years ago) but the exercise was theraputic.  This picture?  &lt;em&gt;Bang!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

You&#39;d know that it bears those &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook1k.html&#34;&gt; terrible historical resonances&lt;/a&gt; of centuries of wars to rid Jerusalem of the so-called &lt;em&gt;infidels&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;04&#34;&gt;2001/09/04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More interesting items on the Tampa crisis, from yesterday&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/0109/04/A60129-2001Sep3.html&#34;&gt;Sydney Morning Herald Web Diary&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ll quote a few juicy tidbits.  First, some important insight from Margo Kingston, the proprietor of the web diary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Outsourcing refugee processing, that&#39;s what this is. The refugees lose the protection of our laws. As I write, there&#39;s no answers on &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; will process, and under what &lt;em&gt;laws&lt;/em&gt; on Nauru. Nauru is not a signatory to the United Nations convention on refugees. I think Howard is leaving the way open for our warships to intercept the boats outside our territory, and pick them up provided they go to Nauru. This is Howard&#39;s fuck-you to the lawyers and the Courts who have insisted that refugees are people too, with the same human and legal rights as the rest of us.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It&#39;s one of those interesting tensions between our government and the court system.  The ruckus over native title is not unique.  Similarly, reacting to criticism of the perceived &lt;em&gt;bias&lt;/em&gt; in the Sydney Morning Herald&#39;s reporting of the issue (a person wrote that the typical &#34;left-leaning elite&#34;, such as Tim Costello, is wheeled out to criticise the decision)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our readership is strongly against the Tampa actions, by more than two two to one, judging by letters to the editor. The left &#34;elite&#34; died a long time ago. It&#39;s now in a small minority, as the events of last week showed. I assume you&#39;re not suggesting minority opinion shouldn&#39;t get a run? You&#39;ll notice that despite our reader&#39;s opinions, our editorial line has been positive to Howard&#39;s actions on the Tampa. I would have thought the Herald is maintaining good diversity of views on this. What I can&#39;t understand is that even when the masses are winning hands down, they and their supporters still cry foul when people who&#39;ve lost hands-down insist on a say. A sign of the darkness to come? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I hadn&#39;t noticed that, but checking, yes it&#39;s the case.  The Herald&#39;s own editorial position is in favour of the government line.  So much for the claim that the paper is the mouthpiece of the left-leaning &#34;elite.&#34;
&lt;p&gt;
A final point, from an Australian living in Denmark:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One last point. I have heard the refugees being described many things, such as &#34;criminals&#34; and &#34;fakes&#34; ... one of the central tenants of our justice system is the concept of innocent until proven guilty, and I feel that these people deserve the benefit of the doubt, at least until their bonafides can be checked out.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed.  Is that too much to ask?  Apparently, in contemporary Australia, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;03&#34;&gt;2001/09/03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-09-03.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0109/03/national/national1.html&#34;&gt;Tampa crisis&lt;/a&gt;, which is gripping this country and the region: some people just don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; the sense of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0108/31/opinion/opinion1.html&#34;&gt;outrage&lt;/a&gt; that some of us feel about the treatment of the asylum seekers, stranded on the Norweigan freighter off the coast of Christmas Island.  
&lt;p&gt;
The issue is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about whether or not these people would be recognised as &#34;genuine&#34; refugees by the UNHCR or our immigration authorities.  The issue is straightforward.  We are treating these people inhumanely whether or not they are &#34;genuine&#34; refugees.  Our country is acting in a way which is undoubtedly racist.  Had this been an illegally loaded boat of New Zealanders, and had we known that 60% of them would overstay their visas in staying in Australia, we would at least let them &lt;em&gt;land&lt;/em&gt; in Christmas Island and process their applications with care.  The fact that these people are from &lt;em&gt;elsewhere&lt;/em&gt; seems sadly relevant in the national psyche.  (The comments about Muslims and violence and dissolving the moral fabric of our country which were repeated on talkback radio are just sickening.)  If people come to our doorstep in some kind of need, we ought to be generous with our resources.  There is no need to run an &#34;open door&#34; policy on immigration, but we at least ought to process applications for refugee status quickly, politely, and humanely.  Is that too much to ask?
&lt;p&gt;
It also seems relevant that the Australian coastal authorities led the Tampa to troubled boat of asylum seekers and directed them to help.  If I were the captain of that vessel, I&#39;d be feeling more than slightly let down by Australia.  As an Australian citizen, I feel more than slightly embarrased by my country: how can we think that it is acceptable to palm off a significant proportion of the processing work to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0109/03/national/national1.html&#34;&gt;Nauru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Two more salient facts are worth considering in this discussion.
&lt;p&gt;
First: The world seems to be constructed in such a way as to allow the free flow of money, but not of people.  Why is that?  Is money more important than people?  Why is it called &#34;international commerce&#34; when it comes to capital, but &#34;people smuggling&#34; when people employ other people to get them from one place they don&#39;t want to be to another place they&#39;d prefer to be?
&lt;p&gt;
Second: Did the First Fleet which came to invade or colonise this continent in 1788 follow the required immigration checks with the prior population of this land?  If not, why not?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;02&#34;&gt;2001/09/02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found in this weekend&#39;s magazine in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/&#34;&gt;Herald&lt;/a&gt;, a quote from Michel Houellebecq&#39;s book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099283360/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Atomised&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Children once existed solely to inherit a man&#39;s genes, his moral code and his name. This was taken for granted among the aristocracy, but merchants, craftsmen and peasants also bought into the idea, it became the norm at every level of society. That&#39;s all gone now... there&#39;s nothing for my son to inherit. I have no craft to teach him. I haven&#39;t a clue what he might do when he&#39;s older. By the time he grows up, the rules I lived by will be meaningless--the world will be completely different. If a man accepts this... then his life is reduced to nothing more than the sum of his own experience--past and future generations mean nothing to him. That&#39;s how we live now. For a man to bring a child into the world now is meaningless.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Found, courtesy of Google, a thoughtful essay entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/highlights/essay_taylors_june01/&#34;&gt;Politics for Babies&lt;/a&gt;, by  Laurie and Michael Taylor.  Michael Taylor, the director of the UK based &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;IPPR&lt;/a&gt;, which is a centre-left think-tank.
&lt;p&gt;
This is another example of how one thing leads to another.

You&#39;d think that a philosopher with more than a passing knowledge of logic would have something sensible and productive to say about what makes public discussion &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.  But I don&#39;t have much to say.  I&#39;d like to, one day.  Does anyone have any ideas of what other things would be good to read to get up to speed in the area?  If so, please &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archive/2001/08/27&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;25&#34;&gt;2001/08/25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-08-25.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;24&#34;&gt;2001/08/24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

To help Roberta celebrate my arrival, our chivalrous and irreproachably
well-mannered landlord had bestowed upon her two hard-to-come-by tickets to the
Bolshoi.
&lt;p&gt;
We went the following evening. Gisele was on the program, the same ballet I&#39;d
seen performed five years ago during my first visit to Moscow. At that time the
theater had been shabby, with grimy scaffolding from ongoing renovations
concealing its fissured neo-Romanesque fa&amp;#231;ade. The work had since been
completed, the cast-iron chariot and four-horse cortege over the portico was
meticulously restored, and the whole majestic front was splashed with cozy, pink
light.
&lt;p&gt;
The audience had also undergone a remarkable transformation. Gone were the
graying American retirees in Bermuda shorts and sensible shoes, the
camera-clutching tour groups from England, and the prim Muscovite mothers, who
had no doubt scrimped so that their daughters could see Russian culture in its
highest form. In their stead sat row upon row of American and British bankers,
lawyers, and accountants in somber, fashionable suits. Those Russian daughters,
I could not fail to notice, had grown up in all the right places. They snuggled
with the emissaries of foreign finance, and shot one another catty, competitive
glances.
&lt;p&gt;
The most beautiful women sat with the beefy Russian businessmen. These
pencil-thin molls favored form-fitting body suits patterned after various feline
predators. They toted chic Fendi bags from which they plucked tiny cell-phones
with long, painted nails.
&lt;p&gt;
Mobile phones chirped, rang, and buzzed incessantly throughout the performance,
while hushed conversations in several languages echoed from the four corners of
the gallery. I understood now why Mikhail Mikhailovich had told Roberta he never
went to the ballet anymore. Yet I did not find the vulgarity repulsive. It was
tantalizing, theatrical. Even the sinewy ballerinas fluttering about the stage
were either too wrapped up in their routines to complain about the ruckus or had
long ago realized that the real show at the Bolshoi was now the audience.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt; I had seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lodestone.org/users/maria/stadi.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; collection of photos before making my trip!  It would have helped me decide what to go to search out.  (And I would have made a trip into the library had I known it had &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lodestone.org/users/maria/stadi/ss/ss12.html&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ceiling!  It was just next door to where I was teaching.)&lt;/p&gt;

It was good to meet lots of people I had email corresponded with, and plenty I hadn&#39;t.  Most fun were the crazy Russian students: Hi &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~dxc/&#34;&gt;Dmitry&lt;/a&gt;, Anna, Valentin, Ivan!
&lt;p&gt;
More later.  Now to catch up on those emails and the pile of work waiting for me here.
&lt;/p&gt;

Today Sydney, tomorrow &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/esslli&#34;&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s a long, attenuated day today, with stops in Singapore and London.  I start teaching on Monday, and stop on Friday, then get on the plane Saturday morning to return home early on Sunday.  It&#39;s a crazy timetable, but somebody&#39;s got to do it.
&lt;p&gt;
Expect a raft of pictures from Helsinki, if all goes well.  Not next week, but sometime after that.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;07&#34;&gt;2001/08/07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/misc/code_red_log.txt&#34;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of the distribution of a worm&lt;/em&gt;:  The &#34;Code Red&#34; worm is a pretty active beast.  Since July 20, I&#39;ve had &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/misc/code_red_log.txt&#34;&gt;274&lt;/a&gt; different attacks.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/misc/code_red_log.txt&#34;&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt; show the story: there was a short burst on July 20, one on August 1, and then the flood.  Each was exactly the same request string:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
GET /default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN%u9090%
u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7
801%u9090%u9090%u8190%u00c3%u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u000
0%u00=a  HTTP/1.0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Until August 5, when I got hit by a new strain, involving a string of Xs, rather than Ns.
&lt;p&gt;
It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s going to let up anytime soon.  It&#39;s a good thing that I&#39;m running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; and not &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/itsolutions/security/topics/codealrt.asp&#34;&gt;a webserver vulnerable to this worm&lt;/a&gt;.


&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;05&#34;&gt;2001/08/05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&#34;Partway through Elliotte Rusty Harold&#39;s talk about namespaces, I realized where this relentless drive toward abstraction was taking us. Every new level of abstraction draws the computer-based world closer to the concepts we talk about in the real world. We&#39;ve moved from waves to bits to data to information to infosets to application objects. As this process continues, some ambitious Comp Sci graduate student will realize that somebody already created the tree structure mapping the highest level of reality. That person was, of course, G. W. F. Hegel. Hegel&#39;s dialectic led him to create a map of reality that, at the top of the tree structure, divided everything into either the material or the spiritual realm. That dichotomy was resolved in God, and, my friends, that&#39;s about as far as you can go. 
&lt;p&gt;
&#34;That ambitious Comp Sci grad student, eager to get his Ph.D. and begin making real money, will create The Two Final Infosets: MatterML and SpiritML. Then, late one night, as rain falls in torrents and lightning flashes outside his laboratory windows, he&#39;ll run XSLT to transform the material world to the spiritual world. We&#39;ll be gone. The last material object on earth will be that graduate student&#39;s open copy of XML in a Nutshell. It makes an editor in chief proud, in a perverse kind of way.&#34; 
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;2001/08/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;hi·a·tus&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li /&gt;a break in something where there should be continuity
&lt;li /&gt;an opening or aperture in an organ, for example, the opening in the diaphragm for the oesophagus
&lt;li /&gt;a break in pronunciation between two vowels that are next to each other in consecutive syllables without an intervening consonant, as in &#34;re-examine&#34;
&lt;li /&gt;a gap where something is missing, especially in manuscripts
&lt;/ol&gt;
Enjoy the break.  My writing energies for the next little while will be spent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.

Dear Science Warriors,&lt;p&gt;
Isn&#39;t &#34;paraconsistent logic&#34; as far removed from reality as the
most far-fetched of post-modernist hokum?  If so, why have you kept
silent regardng those who allow that a proposition may be both true
and false (at the same time and in the same respect)?&lt;p&gt;
      Is this irrational doctrine any the less to be deplored because
it issues from the mouths of influential logicians?  If not, why
haven&#39;t you censured those responsible for this irrationalist hype?
Could it be because their backers include the Association of Symbolic
Logic and the editors of _Mind_ and _Logique et Analyse_?&lt;p&gt;
      O warriors of science: what will you do, now that the dialethic
disease has taken root in mathematical logic?  Will you recognise that
the apostles of inconsistency are the vilest of charlatans?  Will you
indict your own kind for mathematical decadence, for having gotten in
bed (many for grants) with the henchmen of this nefast movement? Or
will you find some pretext for justifying an intellectual
licentiousness that you would have lost no time in repudiating had it
been indulged by post-modernists?
&lt;p&gt;
Cordially,
Spartacus

&lt;p&gt;&#34;If a German philosopher emulated Dummett and published a 700-page tome about Frege without a single quotation or reference, any acclaim would be tempered by ridicule.&#34; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/highlights/words_things_apr99/&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;18&#34;&gt;2001/07/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last it&#39;s official.  As of July 1, 2002, I&#39;ll be an Associate Professor in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  Coming to the decision wasn&#39;t easy -- especially in waiting for the job to come through for Christine -- but it&#39;s all fallen into place pretty well.  (Well, apart from somewhere to live, and a few other things like that.)  Wish us luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;17&#34;&gt;2001/07/17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article &lt;a href=&#34;http://can.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/&#34;&gt;Logic and Terror&lt;/a&gt; by A. R. D. Mathias, is an interesting short history of the tightrope that Soviet logicians had to walk in the last century.  Stalin was a smart guy.  The qualities of intelligence, power and viciousness are a hard mix to deal with.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is generally recognised that no science can develop and ourish without a battle of
opinions, without freedom of criticism. But those generally recognised rule was ignored
and outed in the most outrageous fashion. A tight group of infallible leaders, having
insured themselves against all possible criticism began to act arbitrarily and highhandedly.
To give one example: the so called Baku course, by N.Y.Marr, unreservedly included in
the lists of manuals recommended to students. This means that the students were deceived
by having a rejected &#34;course&#34; presented to them as a first class text-book.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If I were not convinced of the integrity of comrade Meshchaninov and the other
linguistic leaders, I would say that such conduct is tantamount to sabotage.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
N.Y.Marr introduced into linguistics the incorrect non-Marxist formula that language is
a superstructure, and got himself into a muddle and put linguistics into a muddle. Soviet
linguistics cannot be advanced on the basis of an incorrect formula.
I think that the sooner our linguistics is rid of N.Y.Marr&#39;s errors the sooner will it be
possible to extricate it from its present crisis.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If my own vice-chancellor involved herself in my setting of my course curriculum to this extent, I&#39;d be worried.  If it were &lt;em&gt;Stalin&lt;/em&gt;, I think I&#39;d get out of the profession and work as a manual labourer instead.
&lt;/p&gt;

That was the question I asked of myself when I read the story.&lt;/p&gt;

Tasmania was a blast.  Lots of fun, lots of philosophy, lots of good conversation.  It&#39;s a good time to be active and thinking and working.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Things have been quiet on the website front, but hectic elsewhere.  Hot water systems needing replacing (and the saga taking three days), Zack going through a sleepless phase (which seems over for the moment, at least), floorboards in the dining room popping because of wet weather and bad ventilation, and &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;.  More activity seems to be happening &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; than here at present.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m in Tasmania for the 2001 Australasian Association for Philosophy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.utas.edu.au/docs/humsoc/philosophy/seminars/announcement.html&#34;&gt;Conference&lt;/a&gt;, and in particular, for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/pluralism2001/&#34;&gt;logical pluralism stream&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s way too much fun to be spending any time here.   Enjoy an &lt;em&gt;embrace&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oir.ucf.edu/wm/paint/auth/klee/&#34;&gt;Paul Klee&lt;/a&gt; in my absence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-06-31.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative energy is a crazy thing.  It took me a while to hit my stride with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; back when I was starting, and it feels like a transition has come with Zachary&#39;s birth too.  Now, time to think and write is more concentrated.  More focussed.  I can&#39;t tolerate timewasting to anywhere near the same extent as before. (Actually, this reminds me of the time I moved from my postdoc at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anu.edu.au/&#34;&gt;ANU&lt;/a&gt; to a teaching position at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Macquarie&lt;/a&gt;.  The concentration of time in regular teaching commitments at Macquarie meant that I couldn&#39;t waste time to the extent that I did at ANU when I had a research only 2.5 years.  Now I can&#39;t waste time to even the extent that I did when childless.  (What did I do with all the time I now spend with him?  I have no idea where it all went.  Some of it was spent on this site, no doubt.)  
&lt;p&gt;
The creative energy is still there, not squelched by the squeeze in available time.  Let&#39;s see if it will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;29&#34;&gt;2001/06/29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The productions of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures. But all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known; not in the number of axioms. [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/bacon-aphor.html&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;27&#34;&gt;2001/06/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that I&#39;ve not been speaking here in my own voice much lately.  It&#39;s mainly been my betters speaking for me, instead of &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; speaking for me.  One reason, is that my own voice has been utilised &lt;a href=&#34;ftp://www.phil.mq.edu.au/pub/grestall/HPPLrssl.pdf&#34;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.  That &lt;a href=&#34;ftp://www.phil.mq.edu.au/pub/grestall/HPPLrssl.pdf&#34;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; is an historical essay on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ftp://www.phil.mq.edu.au/pub/grestall/HPPLrssl.pdf&#34;&gt;Relevant and Substructural Logics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Read, inwardly digest, enjoy, and above all, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archive/2001/06/27&#34;&gt;give me feedback&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
(Brace yourself, though.  It&#39;s a 1.1MB, 105 page pdf file consisting of roughly 50,000 words.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;26&#34;&gt;2001/06/26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We maintain that the business of philosophy is nothing other than to look into creation and to ponder over it in order to be guided to the Creator -- in other words, to look into the meaning of existence. For the knowledge of creation leads to the cognizance of the Creator, through the knowledge of the created. The more perfect becomes the knowledge of creation, the more perfect becomes the knowledge of the Creator. The Law encourages and exhorts us to observe creation. Thus, it is clear that this is to be taken either as a religious injunction or as something approved by the Law. But the Law urges us to observe creation by means of reason and demands the knowledge thereof through reason. [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1190averroes.html&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;25&#34;&gt;2001/06/25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-06-25.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;23&#34;&gt;2001/06/23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call any quantity a &lt;em&gt;Genitum&lt;/em&gt;, which is not made by addition or subduction of divers parts, but is generated or produced in arithmetic by the multiplication, division, or extraction of the root of any terms whatsoever; in geometry by the invention of contents and sides, or of the extreams and means of proportionals. Quantities of this kind are products, quotients, roots, rectangles, squares, cubes, square and cubic sides and the like. These quantities I here consider as variable and indetermined, and increasing or decreasing as it were by a perpetual motion or flux; and I understand their momentaneous increments or decrements by the name of Moments; so that the increments may be esteem&#39;d as added, or affirmative moments; and the decrements as subducted, or negative ones. But take care not to look upon finite particles as such. Finite particles are not moments, but the very quantities generated by the moments. We are to conceive them as the just nascent principles of finite magnitudes. Nor do we in this Lemma regard the magnitude of the moments, but their first proportion as nascent. It will be the same thing, if, instead of moments, we use either the Velocities of the increments and decrements (which may also be called the motions, mutations, and fluxions of quantities) or any finite quantities proportional to those velocities. The coefficient of any generating side is the quantity which arises by applying the Genitum to that side.

&lt;p&gt;Working quickly I have completed this letter in a single night anxious alike to gratify a friend and to try my hand on a rhetorical theme. Then early in the morning he has knocked at my door on the point of starting. I wish also to shew my detractors that like them I too can say the first thing that comes into my head. I have, therefore, introduced few quotations from the scriptures and have not, as in most of my books, interwoven its flowers in my discourse. The letter has been, in fact, dictated off-hand and poured forth by lamp-light so fast that my tongue has outstripped my secretaries&#39; pens and that my volubility has baffled the expedients of shorthand. I have said this much that those who make no allowances for want of ability may make some for want of time.

&lt;p&gt;As the Philosopher said in the second Metaphysicorum, &#39;as a thing is related to existence, so is it related to truth,&#39; the reason of which is that the truth about a thing (which is established in the truth as in its subject) is a perfect likeness of the thing as it is.
&lt;p&gt;
Now of things which exist some so exist as to have absolute being in themselves; others so exist as to have a being dependent on something else, by some kind of relation, for example &#39;being at the same time&#39; or &#39;being related to something else,&#39; like the correlatives &#39;father and son,&#39; &#39;master and servant,&#39; &#39;double and half,&#39; &#39;whole and part,&#39; and the like, as such; and because the being of such depends on something else, it follows that the truth of them also depends on something else; for if we have no knowledge of half we can never understand double, and so of the rest.

&lt;p&gt;The user interface people at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; seem to be doing quite a few things right.  One of the non-obvious things they&#39;re doing right is paying attention to URLs as &lt;em&gt;interface&lt;/em&gt;.  The average &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/041521534X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon URL&lt;/a&gt; is not particularly memorable.  However, that doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t use sensible things in that field.  Now that the front page is just their general shop front, you need to go to different places to focus on different categories.  Try &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/books/&#34;&gt;www.amazon.com/books&lt;/a&gt; to get to the books, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/music/&#34;&gt;www.amazon.com/music&lt;/a&gt; to get to the music.  They&#39;re not URLs you&#39;ll find as links anywhere on the site.  They are just things that people like me are prone to try.  And someone there at Amazon has made sure that they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must inquire into the nature of causes, and see what the various kinds of cause are and how many there are. Since our treatment of the subject aims at knowledge, and since we believe that we know a thing only when we can say why it is as it is -- which in fact means grasping its primary causes -- plainly we must try to achieve this with regard to the way things come into existence and pass away out of it, and all other natural change, so that we may know what their principles are and may refer to these principles in order to explain everything into which we inquire.

Christine has gone in to work to see how that goes.  It&#39;s all OK so far, but I haven&#39;t had the first feed yet.  I&#39;ve fed him before, but only in the evening, when he&#39;s less hungry.  It will be interesting to see how he takes the bottle at 10am or 11am or so.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Later&lt;/em&gt;:  Zack was an angel all day.  Apart from some understandable narkiness at the sight/taste/texture of milk coming from a &lt;em&gt;bottle&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;mother&lt;/em&gt;, he was a delight from beginning to end.  He cries, but for reasonably well-understood reasons.  You pay him some attention, and he rewards you with affection.  You leave him be when he&#39;s tired, and he falls asleep by himself.  Not just once, but three times today he&#39;s fallen asleep unaided, in his bassinet.  He seems to be getting the hang of this living business.  And we seem to be getting the hang of this looking-after-a-small-person business.
&lt;p&gt;
Not only that, but I managed to get about ten pages written.  I&#39;m getting back in the writing groove.&lt;/p&gt;

(Except &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.speedysnail.com/walkingwest/3/2001_06_10_archive.html&#34;&gt;he&#39;s leaving there&lt;/a&gt; and we &lt;em&gt;could be&lt;/em&gt; going there.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want me to tell you why God is to be loved and how much. I answer, the reason for loving God is God Himself; and the measure of love due to Him is immeasurable love. Is this plain? Doubtless, to a thoughtful man; but I am debtor to the unwise also. A word to the wise is sufficient; but I must consider simple folk too. Therefore I set myself joyfully to explain more in detail what is meant above.
&lt;p&gt;
We are to love God for Himself, because of a twofold reason; nothing is more reasonable, nothing more profitable. When one asks, Why should I love God? he may mean, What is lovely in God? or What shall I gain by loving God? In either case, the same sufficient cause of love exists, namely, God Himself.

&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uws.edu.au/AEGIS/staff-%20brian.html&#34;&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s father passed away suddenly last month.  He has been remembered in many ways, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.aph.gov.au/search/ParlInfo.ASP?action=view&amp;amp;item=122&amp;amp;from=browse&amp;amp;path=Chamber/House+Hansard/2001/Winter/7+June+2001&amp;amp;items=135&#34;&gt;this entry&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/index.htm&#34;&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;, the proceedings of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aph.gov.au/&#34;&gt;Parliament of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot expect that the wisest men of our remotest posterity, who can base their conclusions upon thousands of years of accurate observation, will reach a decision on this subject without some measure of reserve. Such being the case, it might appear the dictate of wisdom to leave its consideration to some future age, when it may be taken up with better means of information than we now possess. But the question is one which will refuse to be postponed so long as the propensity to think of the possibilities of creation is characteristic of our race. The issue is not whether we shall ignore the question altogether, like Eve in the presence of Raphael; but whether in studying it we shall confine our speculations within the limits set by sound scientific reasoning. Essaying to do this, I invite the reader&#39;s attention to what science may suggest, admitting in advance that the sphere of exact knowledge is small compared with the possibilities of creation, and that outside this sphere we can state only more or less probable conclusions.

Now 17, David hit on the idea of building a model breeder reactor, a nuclear reactor that not only generates electricity, but also produces new fuel. His model would use the actual radioactive elements and produce real reactions. His blueprint was a schematic in one of his father&#39;s textbooks.

Ignoring safety, David mixed his radium and americium with beryllium and aluminum, all of which he wrapped in aluminum foil, forming a makeshift reactor core. He surrounded this radioactive ball with a blanket of small foil-wrapped cubes of thorium ash and uranium powder, tenuously held together with duct tape.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 As the article says, do not try to build a nuclear reactor at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps there are some that neglect this way of pleasure and rest satisfied in the enjoyment of their friends, calling friendship the most desirable of all things, more necessary than either air, fire, or water; so delectable that he that shall take it out of the world had as good put out the sun; and, lastly, so commendable, if yet that make anything to the matter, that neither the philosophers themselves doubted to reckon it among their chiefest good. But what if I show you that I am both the beginning and end of this so great good also?  Nor shall I go about to prove it by fallacies, sorites, dilemmas, or other the like subtleties of logicians, but after my blunt way point out the thing as clearly as it were with my finger.

&lt;p&gt;Often the hearts of men and women are stirred, as likewise they are soothed in their sorrows more by example than by words. And therefore, because I too I have known some consolation from speech had with one who was a witness thereof, am I now minded to write of the sufferings which have sprung out of my misfortunes, for the eyes of one who, though absent, is of himself ever a consoler. This I do so that, in comparing your sorrows with mine, you may discover that yours are in truth nought, or at the most but of small account, and so shall you come to bear them more easily.

&lt;p&gt;
Some advice: If you&#39;re an undergraduate attempting to take the short-cut to a good grade on an essay, by plagiarising.  For your own sake, attempt to plagiarise from someone writes no better than you do.  There is something thoroughly disconcerting about the jump from turgid, knotted, ungrammatical prose to smooth, well written text.  It&#39;s &lt;em&gt;dead easy&lt;/em&gt; for us to spot.  
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, if you &lt;em&gt;can&#39;t tell&lt;/em&gt; the difference yourself, it&#39;s rather hard for you to follow this advice.  Learning to read well goes hand-in-hand with learning to write well.  Learning how to plagiarise well should hopefully go hand-in-hand with not needing to plagiarise.

Thinking, thinking, thinking.  Not just about work, but about our &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;.  There&#39;s some decisions which need making.  Big decisions.  Really big decisions.  Anyone &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_05#29&#34;&gt;got any advice&lt;/a&gt;?  How do you approach life-direction-changing decisions?

Once upon a time them was a universe. In this universe there was a planet. On this planet there was virtually no laughter. Nothing like ``humor&#39;&#39; was really known. People never laughed, nor jested, nor kidded, nor joked, nor anything like that. The inhabitants were extremely serious, conscientious, sincere, hard-working, studious, well wishing, and moral. But of humor they knew nothing. All except for a small minority who had some feeling for what humor was. These people occasionally laughed and joked. Their behavior was extremely alarming to everyone else and was regarded as an obviously pathological phenomenon. These few people were called ``laughers,&#39;&#39; and they were promptly hospitalized. What was so alarming about their behavior was not only the strange noises they made and the peculiar facial expressions they bore while ``laughing,&#39;&#39; but the utterly pathological things they said! They seemed to lose all sense of reality. They said things which were totally irrational, indeed sometimes logically self-contradictory. In short, they behaved exactly like anyone else who was deluded or hallucinated, hence they were put into hospitals.

Are you a philosopher?  Are you a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; philosopher?  Are you looking for a good job, with future prospects?  Do you want to work in a healthy, growing, lively department with good students?  If so, look &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pers.mq.edu.au/ads/2001/May/scmp.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;23&#34;&gt;2001/05/23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

There&#39;s no doubt about it: Caring for small children really takes it out of you.  I&#39;m tired in ways I haven&#39;t been tired for ages.  Christine is moreso.  At least I get the chance to take a break and teach classes.  Christine is on call for most of the day.  Zack is an incredibly good baby (almost invariably sleeping through from around midnight to around 5am) but the hours before midnight can be trying for all three of us. The point?  Please understand if your friends with newborns &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; after the birth of their child.  If they don&#39;t, they&#39;re not doing it right.  
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, I can say more: if they don&#39;t they&#39;re probably male and are not involved in childcare.  It has been interesting to hear the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s293487.htm&#34;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/dept/ssal/staff/susanmaushart/&#34;&gt;Susan Maushart&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s new book &lt;em&gt;Wifework&lt;/em&gt;.  The basic thesis of the book is sound: it&#39;s so very easy for a man in a heterosexual relationship to leave everything to do with running the household and looking after kids to his partner.  It&#39;s an insidious form of infantilism, and it&#39;s inherently unstable as anyone familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wpunj.edu/cohss/philosophy/courses/hegel/MASLAVE.HTM&#34;&gt;Hegel&#39;s analysis of the Master/Slave dialectic&lt;/a&gt; will recognise.
&lt;p&gt;
As Christine and I joke to each other: &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; should have a wife.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s a lot easier for men to find them than women.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is loads of fun.  (At least, to a logician like me.)  It&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF&#34;&gt;Grammatical Framework&lt;/a&gt;: a collection of packages in the functional programming language &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; which help you do interesting things with language.  It&#39;s beautiful because it uses some technology from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/&#34;&gt;logics I like&lt;/a&gt;, and it can do really neat things, such as translation.  One simple but striking example results from when you translate a formal proof like this:
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;!--- &lt;IMG SRC=&#34;/images/proof.gif&#34; WIDTH=&#34;500&#34; HEIGHT=&#34;126&#34; BORDER=&#34;1&#34; ALT=&#34;a formal proof&#34;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
into a piece of English text like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Theorem. For all numbers x, x is even or x is odd.
&lt;p&gt;
Proof. We proceed by induction. For the basis, by the first axiom of
evenness, zero is even. A fortiori, zero is even or zero is odd.
For the induction step, consider a number x and assume x is even or x
is odd with x=x (h). By the hypothesis h, x is even or x is odd. There are
two possibilities. First, assume x is even ( a ). By the hypothesis a,
x is even. By the second axiom of evenness, the successor of x is
odd. A fortiori, the successor of x is even or the successor of x is
odd. Second, assume x is odd ( b ). By the hypothesis b, x is odd.
By the third axiom of evenness, the successor of x is even. A
fortiori, the successor of x is even or the successor of x is odd.
Thus the successor of x is even or the successor of x is odd in both
cases. Hence, for all numbers x, x is even or x is odd. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If only all my students could write so well.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;19&#34;&gt;2001/05/19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things are linked to other, quite different things.  Looking up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/&#34;&gt;Richard Heck&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s work &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/html/philosophy.html&#34;&gt;on Frege&lt;/a&gt; I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/sitin.pdf&#34;&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~heck/sitin2.pdf&#34;&gt;involvement&lt;/a&gt; in the Harvard Living Wage Campaign.  That reminded me to check up on how the campaign was going (you don&#39;t know about it?  It was a student-led sit in to encourage the Harvard Administration to pay every full time worker at Harvard enough to actually survive on.  Radical idea, I know.)  Anyway, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~pslm/livingwage/index.html&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; gives you the run-down on how the campaign has gone.  In summary, there are improvements, but the situation is not ideal.  That&#39;s the most we can expect in these sorts of political action, but it&#39;s obviously not the most you can ask or campaign for.  (What&#39;s an &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; if it&#39;s not something to aim at?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;18&#34;&gt;2001/05/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;17&#34;&gt;2001/05/17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, a postcard appeared in my pigeonhole at work: it advertised the website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/highered/enews&#34;&gt;e-news on higher education&lt;/a&gt;, at which you can see what the Federal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/&#34;&gt;Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs&lt;/a&gt; takes to be interesting news in higher education.  It&#39;s not particularly gripping reading, but I suppose I have to keep in touch with what those with the purse strings take to be important.

&lt;p&gt;
Browsing around there, I was lead to the page &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/&#34;&gt;Which Course? Which University?&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to give an overview of undergraduate courses available in the higher education system, with an aim to advising potential entry level students.  What you actually &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; is another thing.  It&#39;s a hodge-podge where every institution provides its own &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/arts/9macquarie.html&#34;&gt;marketing-speak&lt;/a&gt; designed to cover as many bases as possible.  So, where can I study &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt;?  It turns out that a cursory &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/search/search.asp?qu=philosophy&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; leads me to a list of 130 pages which mention the word &#34;philosophy&#34; (including all of those which mention different institutions&#39; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/tenfields/architecture/2uwa.html&#34;&gt;teaching philosophy&lt;/a&gt;).    The site is of little value for anyone wanting to know the distinctives of this or that university.  Even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usyd.edu.au/&#34;&gt;main&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unsw.edu.au/&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adelaide.edu.au/&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; are little help, as they all speak the usual corporate language, pushing the same buttons, offering everything to everyone.  No university material I have ever seen says &#34;Don&#39;t come here for subject &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, we&#39;re not particularly good at that.  Come here for subject &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.  The people over at institution &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are the place to go to learn &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.&#34;  In these times of maximising enrolment, this will not happen any time soon, either.  It is a pity, because some honesty would not only be good for the students -- it would benefit staff too, who would get students more suited to their own special abilities and interests.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;16&#34;&gt;2001/05/16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-05-16.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&#39;d see someone tout their knowledge of logic in quite &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I repeat, I have *taught* logic. I have studied First Order Logic, Dynamic Logic, Modal Logic, Hybrid Logic, Type Theory, Model Theoretic Semantics, Substructural Logics, Feature Logics, and some more. At grad level. I&#39;d advise you to not take my knowledge here for granted.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I think I&#39;ll try that line sometime.  I&#39;m sure it will impress or intimidate all who hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Virtually everything we were told in Indonesia turned out not to be true, sometimes almost immediately. The only exception to this was when we were told that something would happen immediately, in which case it turned out not to be true over an extended period of time.&#34;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;13&#34;&gt;2001/05/13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/default.htm&#34;&gt;Philosophical Gourmet Report&lt;/a&gt; is out.  The report is notorious among philosophers for being idiosyncratic, opinionated and &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, chiefly because almost no-one is happy for where their institution appears in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/rankings.htm&#34;&gt;rankings&lt;/a&gt;, but also because the rankings (determined by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dla.utexas.edu/depts/philosophy/faculty/leiter/main.html&#34;&gt;one man&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/methods.htm&#34;&gt;contacts&lt;/a&gt;) influence the choices of graduate students deciding where to study.  Any ranking like this is bound to be personal, biased, and as a result, get up the nose of lots of academics.  After all, we&#39;re pretty picky about our own turf.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m not so interested in the rankings (and not because &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; don&#39;t (yet?) appear in the &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/rankings.htm#australasia&#34;&gt;Top 5 Australasian Programs&lt;/a&gt;&#34;).  I&#39;m more interested in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/gourmet/methods.htm#note&#34;&gt;reflections&lt;/a&gt; about the relationship between so-called &#34;analytic&#34; and so-called &#34;continental&#34; philosophy.  There&#39;s some genuine insight there.

&lt;p&gt;
The website is a central repository, not of pictures, but of links to pictures from galleries and museums all over Australia.  Using some tricky &lt;a href=&#34;http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_1/campbell/index.html&#34;&gt;databasing and indexing&lt;/a&gt;, some people at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nla.gov.au/&#34;&gt;National Library&lt;/a&gt; have made a single resource out of a massively scattered collection.  If you want images which reflect on Australia&#39;s culture and heritage, start your browsing or searching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pictureaustralia.org/&#34;&gt;Picture Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There&#39;s a lot of useful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; information there, and it&#39;s a simple way to get a sense on how the open source community are responding to the new operating system.

That probably means that you can&#39;t read this.  It&#39;s the usual story: lots of rain, then the cable gets flooded and we lose the link.  Expect connection here to be spotty for a few days.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0105/hypothesis.html&#34;&gt;On counterfactuals, and on whether a life is worth living&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... when the chorus in &lt;em&gt;Oedipus at Colonus&lt;/em&gt; gloomily declares, &#34;Not to be born is best of all,&#34; the appropriate riposte is: How many are so lucky?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well, perhaps, perhaps not.  If the chorus is saying that for each and every one of us, it would have been better for us not to be born, then that&#39;s not an appropriate response at all.  The point is not how many people are lucky enough not to have come into existence, but rather, of the people who do exist, their existence is a &lt;em&gt;misfortune&lt;/em&gt;.   It&#39;s like when you say that it&#39;s a good idea to avoid harming others.  Exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; many harms have the good fortune of not existing?
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s tricky, counting denizens of the shadowy underworld of the nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;07&#34;&gt;2001/05/07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#34;I&#39;m confused. I keep hearing that big companies are giving big money to political parties. Aren&#39;t the people responsible for these donations the same ones who say that giving the shareholder&#39;s money to charities or to fund a less profitable service to people in the bush is morally wrong because they have a duty to use it for the benefit of shareholders? I guess political donations must have a good rate of return. If they don&#39;t then the donations would be a kind of stealing from shareholders wouldn&#39;t they? So where&#39;s the path to the bottom line?&#34;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family, family, family.
&lt;p&gt;
Today is my mother&#39;s birthday.  Happy birthday, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/hugme.jpg&#34;&gt;Mum&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;p&gt;
2001 is the year I am half my mother&#39;s age.  Were she alive today, she would have been 64.  I am 32.  Zack is zero (plus three and a bit weeks).  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clinton.net/~sammy/64.htm&#34;&gt;When I&#39;m 64&lt;/a&gt;, Zack will be 32.

&lt;p&gt;
This weekend is also a family weekend.  We&#39;re spending time with relatives from Brisbane: my dashing older brother (also featured in the &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/hugme.jpg&#34;&gt;hug me&lt;/a&gt;&#34; picture), his lovely wife and two charming kids, and Christine&#39;s uncomparable younger brother.  This is too many people to (legally) fit in our tiny car (at least if we want to &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; anywhere in it) so we&#39;ll have to be creative about entertaining ourselves and getting out and about.  Let&#39;s see if the public transport system can withstand our onslaught.  It&#39;s either that, or walking, or staying at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;04&#34;&gt;2001/05/04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-05-04.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;03&#34;&gt;2001/05/03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back on the train to and from work.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.burgatronics.net/images/train-error.jpg&#34;&gt;This image&lt;/a&gt; does not inspire confidence in the Sydney Rail system.
&lt;p&gt;
The image was found at the great &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.townhallsteps.com/&#34;&gt;Town Hall Steps&lt;/a&gt;, your resource for everything community and Sydney oriented.  If you&#39;re coming here from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.townhallsteps.com/article.php?story=20010429142040286&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, and you&#39;re looking for the Summer Hill and Dulwich Hill pictures.  Browse &lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04&#34;&gt;last month&#39;s entries&lt;/a&gt;.  This month is &lt;em&gt;closeup&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt; month.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;02&#34;&gt;2001/05/02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-05-02.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At lunchtime today, the photos I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archive/2001/04/28&#34;&gt;ordered on Friday&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metrophoto.com.au/grestall&#34;&gt;Metro Photo&lt;/a&gt; arrived.  The quality is fantastic, of both the 4x6s and 5x7s.  A two megapixel camera is truly your friend.  Except to your hard disk.  My aged (that&#39;s one-and-a-half years old!) PowerBook&#39;s drive is slowly filling up.  (Though the images folder is 300MB full for 700 items, so there&#39;s some way to go yet before I fill the drive and I feel the insane desire to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook&#34;&gt;upgrade&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;2001/05/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/&#34;&gt;back at work&lt;/a&gt; after taking a few weeks off to get to know &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/&#34;&gt;Zachary&lt;/a&gt;, and helping set up new routines in our household to accomodate this new little person. 
&lt;p&gt;
But now, I have to trek in to work and attempt to teach &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/ug/281&#34;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, despite having a brain fogged up with thoughts of Zack: nappies, baths, finding out new things, learning to live, calming him when he&#39;s agitated, and enjoying exploring the world.  It&#39;s a lot like falling in love.  Your thoughts and life have a new focus.  No, that&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s not &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; falling in love again, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; falling in love again.  As always, everything is not the same.  Certainly things are different for Zack.  He has entered a foreign, exciting and dangerous world, full of delights and terrors, after leaving the comparative safety of a womb.  
&lt;p&gt;
So, in a way, have I.&lt;/p&gt;

Interesting things are to be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/&#34;&gt;xrefer&lt;/a&gt;, a compendium of decent reference materials cross-referenced and freely searchable here on the net.  For example, here is Steve Read&#39;s article (from the Oxford Companion to Philosophy) on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=553388&#34;&gt;relevant logic&lt;/a&gt; which explains just a little of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;what I do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some items about Zachary.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I never expected that starting your digestive system was so much &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bother&lt;/em&gt; at the very same time.
&lt;li&gt; It&#39;s a little known fact that children do actually have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.consequently.org/zachary/day5a.jpg&#34;&gt;instruction manuals&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Zack and his dad &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.consequently.org/zachary/day6a.jpg&#34;&gt;know how to sleep&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;li&gt; For a short time only, photos of Zack are available up at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metrophoto.com.au/grestall&#34;&gt;www.metrophoto.com.au/grestall/&lt;/a&gt; for your perusal, and for printing.  (Don&#39;t you want &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metrophoto.com.au/en/Photo/View.asp?P=23896&#34;&gt;a picture of Zack and me&lt;/a&gt; adorning a mousepad, or a mug?  I know I do.)
&lt;li&gt; The fact that I don&#39;t add daily posts about him on this website means that I&#39;m actually spending time with him, rather than writing about him.
&lt;/ul&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/27&#34;&gt;2001/04/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
[Richard] Rorty sympathizes with those—like Thomas Kuhn, to take a prominent example—who have pleaded with him not to characterize their work in ways they find distorting or misleading. &#34;It&#39;s a natural reaction,&#34; he says. &#34;They think of themselves as having made a quite specific point, and with a wave of my hand I seem to subsume their specific point as part of some great cultural movement, or something like that. They think that it&#39;s a way of putting them in bad company and ignoring the really interesting thing they said, which my net is too gross to capture.&#34; Still, Rorty defends this tendency: &#34;I don&#39;t see anything wrong with doing that. Regardless of how they feel about it, if you think there&#39;s a common denominator or a trend, then why not say so?&#34;

(March 2001)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have an idea of the best way to get 2 megapixel JPG files (bigger versions of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; and various other things) printed on high quality photo paper?  I don&#39;t yet want to shell out for a good printer myself.  I want either to upload them to a digital image processing place who print them and send them to me, or to walk into a processing place (in Sydney) with a compactflash card with a pile of images (say, 10 or 20) and they upload them, print them, and give them to me.  It&#39;s not much to ask.  A cursory &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=digital+photo+processing+australia&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; reveals a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ozsearch.oznetwork.com.au/Business/Companies/Photography/Film_Processing/&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fotofast.com.au/&#34;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metrophoto.com.au/&#34;&gt;which&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rabbitphoto.com.au/&#34;&gt;might&lt;/a&gt; do what I&#39;m after.  Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing?  If so, &lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/26&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;Proslogion&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.cla.umn.edu/jhopkins/&#34;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;.  Joy!  
&lt;p&gt;
Here is a snippet: &lt;em&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.cla.umn.edu/jhopkins/proslogion.pdf&#34;&gt;Proslogion&lt;/a&gt;, which
is entitled &lt;em&gt;That God Truly Exists&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, O Lord,
You who give understanding to faith, grant me to understand to the degree
You know to be advantageous that You exist, as we believe, and that You are
what we believe You to be.  Indeed, we believe You to be something than
which nothing greater can be thought.  Or is there, then, no such nature as
You, for the Fool has said in his heart that God does not exist?  But
surely when this very same Fool hears my words &#34;something than which
nothing greater can be thought,&#34; he understands what he hears.  And what he
understands is in his understanding, even if he does not understand it to
exist.  For that a thing is in the understanding is distinct from
understanding that this thing exists.  For example, when a painter
envisions what he is about to paint: he indeed has in his understanding
that which he has not yet made, but he does not yet understand that it
exists.  But after he has painted it: he has in his understanding that
which he has made, and he understands that it exists.  So even the Fool is
convinced that something than which nothing greater can be thought is at
least in his understanding; for when he hears of this being, he understands
what he hears, and whatever is understood is in the understanding.  But
surely that than which a greater cannot be thought cannot be only in the
understanding.  For if it were only in the understanding, it could be
thought to exist also in reality something which is greater than existing
only in the understanding.  Therefore, if that than which a greater cannot
be thought were only in the understanding, then that than which a greater
cannot be thought would be that than which a greater can be thought!  But
surely this conclusion is impossible.  Hence, without doubt, something than
which a greater cannot be thought exists both in the understanding and in
reality.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is a stunning argument.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/24&#34;&gt;2001/04/24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-04-24.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;Two houses, and one satellite TV dish, in Summer Hill.  (February 2001)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; sleep deprived night, a visit to the Early Childhood Centre (and talking things through with an early childhood nurse) works wonders.  I&#39;d give you a link to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ilanet.net.au/clients/marrickville/cs.htm#children&#34;&gt;Dulwich Hill Early Childhood Centre&lt;/a&gt;, but they&#39;re too busy actually looking after people to spend time on creating web presence.
&lt;p&gt;
It has been forever and a day since we last spent over an hour gently talking through issues, joys, thoughts, worries and possibilities with a health professional.  Those tax dollars used to pay for Early Childhood Centres are &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; effective.&lt;/p&gt;

(February 2001)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I think that the meaning of the word &lt;em&gt;universe&lt;/em&gt; is changing.  I think, according to what &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be the meaning of the word, something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/04/13/big.bang.collision/index.html?s=8&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (two &#34;universes&#34; colliding) would be impossible.  
&lt;p&gt;
Why would it be impossible?  Because the universe, whatever it is, is spatiotemporally complete.  If you (or any matter or energy) can get from point A to point B then point A and point B are in the same &#34;universe&#34;.   
&lt;p&gt;
Apparently that&#39;s not what &#34;universe&#34; means any more.  As to what it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; mean, neither this article, nor anything else I&#39;ve seen, tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/21&#34;&gt;2001/04/21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chew on some &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.cofc.edu/faculty/kasman/MATHFICT/&#34;&gt;Mathematical Fiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It&#39;s quite a nice website, once you have an &lt;em&gt;infringement number&lt;/em&gt; to use to get past the welcome page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do you have &lt;em&gt;postscript&lt;/em&gt;?  (You do, if you have a postscript printer, or a postscript interpreter such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/&#34;&gt;Ghostview&lt;/a&gt;.)  If you do, you can use it to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Graphics/text/www/index.html&#34;&gt;draw nice things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/18&#34;&gt;2001/04/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-04-18.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;A house for sale in Dulwich Hill. (February 2001)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i32/32b00701.htm&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a thought-provoking article from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/&#34;&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;.  The point is stated in its title.  The author, Lindsay Waters wants us to &lt;em&gt;Rescue Tenure From the Tyranny of the Monograph&lt;/em&gt;.  The tagline &#34;publish or perish&#34; is not hyperbole.  If you don&#39;t publish (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt;) you won&#39;t get hired, or if you are already hired, you don&#39;t get tenure.  If you&#39;ve got tenure, you won&#39;t get promoted, and you won&#39;t get research grants, and as a result, you won&#39;t get time to do &lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com/&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;.  As a result, you won&#39;t publish so much.  &lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;
The reasons for this dynamic should be clear.  Academics are &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to be researchers, and researchers are &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to publish: research ought to be publically evaluated, it must appear in the public domain.  So much I agree with, wholeheartedly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But how do you measure quality of research?  Apparently, at least if you&#39;re in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/&#34;&gt;Australian higher education bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt;, you do this by &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt;.  This is why in every year we go through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.detya.gov.au/&#34;&gt;DETYA&lt;/a&gt;, during which each &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ro.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;research office&lt;/a&gt; in a university tallies up the &lt;em&gt;quantities&lt;/em&gt; of research &#34;output&#34;.  You get one point for an article in a refereed journal.  Five points for a book.  All of this goes to form the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ro.mq.edu.au/Quantum/Weightings.html&#34;&gt;research quantum&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to calculate funding for your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;, your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scmp.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; and your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;department&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The institutional pressures are clear to everyone in the system.  Publish often.  Publish anything you can. Publish garbage if you must. Why write your entry in an encyclopedia &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-substructural&#34;&gt;concisely&lt;/a&gt; when making it over 4000 words would &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ro.mq.edu.au/Quantum/Weightings.html&#34;&gt;increase its point score from 0.2 to 1&lt;/a&gt;?   Had I been aware of this borderline when writing &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-substructural&#34;&gt;that entry&lt;/a&gt; you can be sure that I would have tried to add the extra few words to bump it over the borderline.  After all, it would have made for at least $2000 extra for my university, and thereby, my department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this makes for the dilution of quality.  We spend less time on producing work with bite, with a wide readership, which might make an impact, which has gone through quality control and multiple drafts, and we publish anything we can, as many times as we can get away with it.  It is not healthy for universities, and neither is it healthy for intellectual culture in general.  However, these are the boundaries which structure our working lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/17&#34;&gt;2001/04/17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;Take the colours of my imagination&lt;br&gt;
Take the scent hanging in the air&lt;br&gt;
Take this tangle of a conversation&lt;br&gt;
and turn it into your own prayer&lt;br&gt;
with my fingers as you want them&lt;br&gt;
with my nails under your hide&lt;br&gt;
with my teeth at your back&lt;br&gt;
and my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies&lt;br&gt;

It&#39;s an interesting name for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.erraticimpact.com/&#34;&gt;website about philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/08&#34;&gt;2001/04/08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-04-08.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;Letterbox #4.

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not writing a lot these days (for reasons obvious to those who know what&#39;s going on in the Restall/Parker household).  Spend the time you save not reading me by browsing around these lovely &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medianugget.com/&#34;&gt;media nuggets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/06&#34;&gt;2001/04/06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-04-06.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;Letterbox #3.  (March 2001)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/05&#34;&gt;2001/04/05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your task for today: have a browse around &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lse.ac.uk/Giddens/Default.htm&#34;&gt;Anthony Giddens&#39; pages&lt;/a&gt; at the LSE.  Get a feel for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lse.ac.uk/Giddens/FAQs.htm&#34;&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt; as he presents it.  (For those of you who have been living under a rock for the last few years, Giddens is one of the social theorists behind the &#34;Third Way&#34; rhetoric and policies undergirding &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pm.gov.uk/&#34;&gt;Blair&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.labour.org.uk/&#34;&gt;New Labour&lt;/a&gt;.)  Then read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ukc.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/rp/toc/105comm.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; critical essay from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ukc.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/rp/&#34;&gt;Radical Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  Then, answer the following question: Does the critical essay hit the mark?  (For bonus points, make the same points as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ukc.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/rp/&#34;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; without resorting to academic jargon.)&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/04&#34;&gt;2001/04/04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-04-04.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;Letterbox #2.  (March 2001)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Australia&#39;s most interesting political commentators, Margot Kingston, has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/webdiary/&#34;&gt;web diary&lt;/a&gt; where she has no editor, and writes up what she&#39;s interested in on a daily basis.  Why have I not seen this before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/03&#34;&gt;2001/04/03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Some say that the internet is a new place for a public culture, but I have my doubts. First, the sheer size of the internet makes the intimacy of an intellectual culture difficult to achieve. Second, there is something about sharing the same space and time in conversation that is denied by the internet, something without which interchange remains too anonymous in character. I don&#39;t think the internet is useless; but it&#39;s ability to substitute for what we have lost is more limited than some folks think.&#34;  A bite of insight from &lt;a href=&#34;http://flag.blackened.net/ias/8may.htm&#34;&gt;Todd May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/02&#34;&gt;2001/04/02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-04-02.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;Letterbox #1.  (March 2001)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pictures for this month are all taken on the streets of Dulwich Hill and Summer Hill, here in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/04/01&#34;&gt;2001/04/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where did all those entries go?  They went away, but you can still visit them, either &lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/03/&#34;&gt;all at once&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/03/01&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/03/02&#34;&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/03/03&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;archive/2001/03/03&#34;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;.  Get the hang of it?  This is not the standard, &lt;em&gt;last few entries on the main page&lt;/em&gt; weblog.  It&#39;s more the &lt;em&gt;one page for each month&lt;/em&gt; kind of deal. This month will be a &lt;em&gt;big month&lt;/em&gt; for me, I think, but a not so big month for this place.  Enjoy the pictures to come, and the occasional update of news when I get to it.&lt;p&gt;

It&#39;s unfashionable to like him, but I can&#39;t help it.  I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/~J.Collis/RVW.html&#34;&gt;Ralph Vaughan Williams&lt;/a&gt;&#39; symphonies.  Call me an unthinking romantic if you must, but while plenty of composers were off &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musiker.at/radio/twelvetoneschools/&#34;&gt;twelve-toning&lt;/a&gt; (and there&#39;s some worthwhile music in that tradition) RVW was composing unfashionable, &#34;nonintellectual&#34; music which stands the test of time and bears his unmistakeable mark.  
&lt;p&gt;
But then, I like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reelclassics.com/Actors/Astaire/astaire.htm&#34;&gt;Fred Astaire&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reelclassics.com/Actresses/Ginger/ginger.htm&#34;&gt;Ginger Rogers&lt;/a&gt; movies too.  Perhaps I am simply an incurable romantic.

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;30&#34;&gt;2001/03/30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; implementation of PDF allows you to &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; PDF files which have been marked as &#34;for viewing and not for printing&#34; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/&#34;&gt;Adobe Acrobat&lt;/a&gt;.  That&#39;s one part of the specification that I think I&#39;m glad &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt; didn&#39;t implement correctly.  I doubt that &lt;a href=&#34;http;//www.adobe.com&#34;&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt; will be happy about that, though.

Those of you who are following the story of my life will be pleased to know that today, the floor sander &amp;amp; polisher has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_06_01_archive.html#388528&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/a&gt; arrived.  If this will not bring on an early labour, I don&#39;t know what will.

The Mac OS X version of IE5.1 can&#39;t cut &amp;amp; paste in browser edit windows (or anywhere else, it seems), which makes it   useless for a web-logger.  Omniweb not only handles text nicely, it uses Apple&#39;s own spell-checker in edit windows.  That&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;images/handy.jpg&#34;&gt;handy&lt;/a&gt;.

This &lt;a href=&#34;images/hugme.jpg&#34;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;, which I first mentioned a few days ago, was from a collection my uncle digitised for my brother and me.  It was disconcerting to see so many pictures I hadn&#39;t seen for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;.  Apparently, I squinted in photos 31 years ago, just as I do now.  It&#39;s apparent too (though I knew this) that my I was always close to both my &lt;a href=&#34;images/hugme.jpg&#34;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; and to my &lt;a href=&#34;images/grandy.jpg&#34;&gt;maternal grandfather&lt;/a&gt;.  What I saw most strikingly in the early pictures was the great &lt;em&gt;loss&lt;/em&gt; experienced my my mother&#39;s side of the family when they pulled up roots and emigrated from Holland to Australia in the early 1950&#39;s.  Brisbane was a cultural wasteland and Australians were a little on the xenophobic side (though it helped that my family were white, of course).  Somehow, they carved a life out for themselves, and for us, and we thrived.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://u2log.com/index.shtml&#34;&gt;U2Log&lt;/a&gt; is a repository of information about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://u2.com/&#34;&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt; tour, which has just started in Miami.  You&#39;ve got to love the internet when you can listen to songs from the show less than 24 hours after it&#39;s finished.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;28&#34;&gt;2001/03/28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_03/#24&#34;&gt;installation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; had its ups and downs (as anyone attempting to visit the site in the last couple of days will have suspected).  Anyway, the machine is running nice and smoothly now.  That wasn&#39;t the case yesterday, when a botched installation of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/macoffice/&#34;&gt;here unnamed mega-corporation&#39;s office suite&lt;/a&gt; not only tied up time, but managed to fry a partition of my disk so badly that neither the friendly &lt;em&gt;Disk Utility&lt;/em&gt; or the last ditch boot into single user mode and &lt;code&gt;fsck&lt;/code&gt; the disk could repair the errors.  This required a reformat/reinstall.  Just as well that my website was safely copied into another partition which survived the apocalypse.
&lt;p&gt;
Upgrading operating systems is not always the simple task that it ought to be.  
&lt;p&gt;
However, once I recovered from &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; rigmarole, I&#39;ve managed to get things done on this machine.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/tour/font.html&#34;&gt;font&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/theater/webtopdf.html&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt; support is just wonderful.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; rips disks and plays uninterrupted.  The Finder is much more responsive than in the public beta, and (apart from my terrible experience with Office [oops!]) Classic MacOS applications run well too.&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;27&#34;&gt;2001/03/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-27.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erasmus seems to like &lt;a href=&#34;http://mac-texier.ircam.fr/textes/c00000091/n00006045/&#34;&gt;avant garde music&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;images/2001-03-27large.jpg&#34;&gt;larger&lt;/a&gt; version of the image.  Endless fame and fortune await you if you can &lt;a href=&#34;news/2001/2001_03/#27&#34;&gt;give titles or references&lt;/a&gt; for the books you can see &lt;a href=&#34;images/2001-03-27large.jpg&#34;&gt;on our shelves&lt;/a&gt;.

For me to write out 100 times after school is over today: &lt;em&gt;When I update the operating system on my server, I must check that the Energy Saver control panel is not set to &#34;put system to sleep  after 30 minutes&#34;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;26&#34;&gt;2001/03/26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back.  I now know more about compiling and configuring &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php.net/&#34;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; than I ever wanted to.  But nonetheless, I&#39;m back, and my computer is now running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/hugme.jpg&#34;&gt;Hug Me&lt;/a&gt;: A picture of my family in 1970.  I&#39;ve just turned one.&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;25&#34;&gt;2001/03/25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-25.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s something distinctly &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt; about the mix of pop-psychology, religion and capitalism displayed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scientology.org/home.html&#34;&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt;.  The so-called &#34;church&#34; of Scientology might send their lawyers after me, but regardless, I feel compelled to point you to the crazy, sad and revealing inside story &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/Xenu/xenu.html#toc&#34;&gt;The Road to Xenu&lt;/a&gt;, written by Margery Wakefield.  It is a perspective from the inside of this organisation.
&lt;p&gt;
For more on Scientology, read her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/us.html&#34;&gt;Understanding Scientology&lt;/a&gt; and her autobiography &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/Web/People/dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/testimony.html&#34;&gt;Testimony&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
For extra bonus credits, consider L. Ron Hubbard&#39;s amazing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/part14/Chp41/pg0744.html&#34;&gt;Logics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is advertised as follows
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Logics were written by L. Ron Hubbard from a summary of information which began in November of 1938 and were published in 1951. They have never varied since that time. 
The Logics form a gradient scale of association of facts necessary to understand and resolve any problem. They are used to predict behavior and clarify the entire field of thought. The Logics are a method of thinking and could be called “how to think.” The basic common denominators of all education may be found in the Logics. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I cannot begin to explain how bad the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/part14/Chp41/pg0744.html&#34;&gt;Logics&lt;/a&gt; are, both in terms of content and &#34;style&#34;.  (It makes me wonder what would have happened had you locked Wittgenstein and Hubbard together in a room for 24 hours what might have emerged.  Still, I&#39;ll take Wittgenstein&#39;s &lt;A HREF=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415028256/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Tractatus&lt;/A&gt; over Hubbard&#39;s Logics any day of the week.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;24&#34;&gt;2001/03/24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yolnguboy.com/&#34;&gt;Yolngu Boy&lt;/a&gt;.  It opened in cinemas here in Sydney a couple of days ago.  It&#39;s a simple coming-of-age story about three aboriginal boys living in Arnhem Land.  Good stuff.

I am rather looking forward to installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; on this server.  So, sometime in this upcoming week, expect a little downtime as I sweep out the old and bring in the new.  I&#39;m pleased to find that when I install the new operating system I&#39;ll be receiving a bucketload of sweet new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/tour/font.html&#34;&gt;fonts&lt;/a&gt;.  (Genuine, complete Unicode sets of &lt;em&gt;Optima&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Didot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gill Sans&lt;/em&gt;, just for starters.)&lt;/p&gt;

It&#39;s clear that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; does a lot of things well.  Try looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hypergene.net/ep2001/img/amazon_news.gif&#34;&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hypergene.net/ep2001/img/amazon_nba.gif&#34;&gt;news stories&lt;/a&gt; would look if publishers followed the same model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;21&#34;&gt;2001/03/21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-21.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some stunning Flash at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.therefore.com/&#34;&gt;therefore&lt;/a&gt;, the site of a UK design firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;20&#34;&gt;2001/03/20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;OK.

If there&#39;s a comment attached to an entry, you&#39;ll see a little statement to that effect at the bottom of the entry.  If not, you&#39;ll see a link prompting you to add one.   In either case, use that link, or the date link at the top of the entry to see the comments form attached to each page and the other comments people have added.

Dear Philosopher,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As we know, high-speed relativity effects are expensive to detect experimentally. 
However, in daily fluid phenomena, we can easily obtain similar Axial contractions, 
Circulating time dilations, and Virtual mass increasements. The maximum light speed in 
space is similar to the terminal propagation speed when the fabric of space is taken as a 
fluid continuum. 
&lt;br&gt;
Now is the turning point for philosophers to be glorified for an open-minded new approach 
upon our fundamental Nature. Early birds please view a comparison table in the following

&lt;p&gt;hi im george, i live in england uk,i believe i discovered that LOGIC   is
IT everything.makes everything,proves everything. the theory
of logic is the theory which makes all laws of physics. im looking for
someone who&#39;s interested about the  discovery i made, you can see it at my

I love the fact that people from all over the world who I&#39;ve never met are coming to visit, because I posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/pluralism2001/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and sent an email around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;17&#34;&gt;2001/03/17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-17.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;16&#34;&gt;2001/03/16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_03/#12&#34;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt; on this channel, I started to explain why I didn&#39;t like Wittgensteinian fideism in talk about God or Ultimate Reality.   (If you&#39;re a late arrival, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_03/#11&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what I&#39;m talking about.) I started by scratching the usual &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rep.routledge.com/atoz/article/U.html&#34;&gt;Use/Mention Distinction&lt;/a&gt;&#34; itch. Let&#39;s go on:
&lt;p&gt;
Once I scratch this itch, it becomes clear to me why fideism is
unappetising.  God in God&#39;s-self is neither an &lt;em&gt;assumption&lt;/em&gt; nor a
&lt;em&gt;conclusion&lt;/em&gt;.  The claim that God exists on the other hand can be a
presupposition &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a conclusion.  The one and the same claim we
make can feature in plenty of different ways.  Take an example from the
sciences.  At different times, the idea that force was mass times
acceleration was treated as a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of force and as a
wonderful &lt;em&gt;consequence&lt;/em&gt; of independent definitions of &#34;Force&#34;,
&#34;mass&#34; and &#34;acceleration&#34;.  As our use of the language changes, so do the
way we treat the terms in those languages.  Language is flexible and can be 
used in many different ways.  To think that the term &#34;God&#34; is only 
avalable for use as an assumption, and that it can&#39;t enter into the give 
and take of the rest of our reasoning practices is to take our practices 
to be much more regimented than they actually are.
&lt;p&gt;
Another example.  Apparently, for the fideist, God doesn&#39;t exist.  No, I 
haven&#39;t said that correctly: apparently it&#39;s not true (or not appropriate) 
to say that God does exist, because to say that something exists is to say 
that it might have not existed.  Similarly, you can&#39;t say that it&#39;s a fact 
that there&#39;s a God, because facts are contingent.  Hmm.  OK.  Here we get a 
weird assumption from the science and philosophy of the late 19th and 
early 20th century infecting our philosophy of religion.  The weird 
assumption is that the only facts are the ways that little bits of the 
world are (an electron here, a patch of colour there...) and the things 
you can make up by piecing these little bits together.  If by &#34;object&#34; you 
mean &#34;piece of the physical world or the world of phenomena&#34; and by &#34;fact&#34; 
you mean &#34;way that the physical world or the world of phenomena is 
arranged&#34; then &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; the existence of God isn&#39;t a fact, and God 
isn&#39;t an object.  
&lt;p&gt;
But that&#39;s not what I mean by these things.  All 
&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; mean by &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; can be explained in a simple phrase: it&#39;s 
a &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; if and only if &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.  For whatever 
&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; you please. So, it&#39;s a fact that 2+2=4 if and only if 2+2=4.  
It&#39;s a fact that Bilbo Baggins lived in Bag End if and only if Bilbo 
Baggins lived in Bag End.  It&#39;s a fact that God predestines the righteous 
if and only if God predestines the righteous.  It&#39;s a fact that there&#39;s a 
fourfold path to enlightenment if and only if there&#39;s a fourfold path to 
enlightenment.  Whether it&#39;s contingent or not doesn&#39;t come in to it.  The 
same goes for objects.  &lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt; I can talk about is an 
&lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt;.   Even God.  Even Ultimate Reality.  Nothing I&#39;ve said presumes that we can &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; God, or &lt;em&gt;comprehend&lt;/em&gt;ultimate reality&lt;/em&gt; but goodness: surely it&#39;s much more likely that the creator of the universe (or the way the &lt;em&gt;whole universe is&lt;/em&gt;) would be much difficult to comprehend than any of our own concepts or ideas.&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;15&#34;&gt;2001/03/15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-15.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve got to admire &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.umaine.edu/~chaitin/&#34;&gt;Gregory Chaitin&lt;/a&gt; for the publicity he manages to garner for himself.  Apparently his work on computability and its limits is so important that he has &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns22811&#34;&gt;shattered mathematics with a single number&lt;/a&gt;&#34;.   Apparently, he&#39;s revolutionised the field of mathematics like so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
TWO plus two equals four: nobody would argue with that. Mathematicians can rigorously prove sums like this, and many other things besides. The language of maths allows them to provide neatly ordered ways to describe everything that happens in the world around us. 

Or so they once thought. Gregory Chaitin ... has shown that mathematicians can&#39;t actually prove very much at all. (Marcus Chown in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns22811&#34;&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of course, he&#39;s done &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; of the sort.  Nothing already proved by mathematicians has been overturned.  The hordes of theorems proved in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://e-math.ams.org/mathscinet/search&#34;&gt;acres of pages of journals&lt;/a&gt; (let alone all of those &lt;a href=&#34;http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/&#34;&gt;on the net&lt;/a&gt;) are not suddenly obselete.  The potential countable infinity of provable mathematical claims has not &lt;em&gt;shrunk&lt;/em&gt; overnight.
&lt;p&gt;
And the fact that there&#39;s plenty in the remit of mathematics which &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be proved is not new with Chaitin either.  G&amp;ouml;del managed that fine on his own.  Yes, Chaitin manages to tie this in with his idiosyncratic definition of randomness and to prove nice things about certain numbers, such as his &lt;em&gt;Omega&lt;/em&gt;.  Good luck to him with it.  But please, reporters, tone down the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns22811&#34;&gt;fanfare&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;14&#34;&gt;2001/03/14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;Well, perhaps I should stock up on Edam and Gouda.  It &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/news/2001/03/item20010314133825_1.htm&#34;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; it will &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aqis.gov.au/docs/pr/mreu.htm&#34;&gt;be in short supply for a while&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
I am very worried about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.incredimail.com/english/splash.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; program.  Please don&#39;t send me mail with it.  Please.  Text is your friend.  Sentences are good things.  Bandwidth sucking images are not a good idea for email.  Neither are sounds.  &lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;13&#34;&gt;2001/03/13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-13.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.austethical.com.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Ethical Investment&lt;/a&gt; seem to be doing Good Things with money.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;12&#34;&gt;2001/03/12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archives/2001/03/11&#34;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; an
explanation of why I found &lt;a
href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archives/2001/03/11&#34;&gt;Wittgensteinian
fideism&lt;/a&gt; in philosophy of religion unappetising.  Here it is.  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Unappetising&lt;/em&gt; is a good word for the view.  There&#39;s value and
insight in it, but on it&#39;s own, it doesn&#39;t make for a satsfying meal.  It&#39;s
revealing and important to understand our conception of God (or of whatever
we take to be ultimately real) to be formed by the way we use words,
concepts and images.  That&#39;s a deep and important insight.  What happens
when people convert?  They learn to use a language.  (Among other things.) 
Some people don&#39;t have competence in the language and don&#39;t share in the
way of life, and as a result we say that they don&#39;t know what we mean.
&lt;p&gt;
So far, so good.  But the step from there to full-blown fideism (that there can 
be no evidence for or against religious claims, there can be no reasons 
for or against religious claims, etc.) is a mighty big one.  
&lt;p&gt;
First, I want to scratch an itch I feel whenever I read passages like &lt;a 
href=&#34;http://consequently.org/archives/2001/03/11&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;.  Given my 
training, it bugs me whenever I see people slipping happily from talking 
about &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; to talking about &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt; for 
things.  When Messer writes &#34;God is a presupposition, not a conclusion&#34;, I 
feel like shaking him and saying, no, for religious believers, God is the 
creator of the heavens and the earth and is neither a presupposition nor a 
conclusion.  The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of God or the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of God might 
be found at the conclusion of an argument, or might be the kind of thing we 
can presuppose or assume.  God in God&#39;s-self is none of those things.   
So, when I read Messer, I need to insert mental quote marks as we jump from 
talking about God to talking about our ideas of God or our claims about 
God or whatever. 
&lt;p&gt;
Now, this &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a trivial matter.  Perhaps Messer is just 
better at mentally jumping levels than I am.  But maybe he&#39;s not.  There 
have been enough people in the grip of an idealism (that everything is an idea) 
or a projectionism about God (that God is a projection of human wishes or hopes 
or fears) for me to think that in this ballpark it&#39;s better to be clearer 
about these things than not.  After all, even if you&#39;re an idealist, you&#39;re 
probably going to want to distinguish yourself from my idea of you; from 
Inspector Moriarty and my idea of him.   Perhaps we ought to extend the same 
courtesy to God.
&lt;p&gt;
More later.
&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;11&#34;&gt;2001/03/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-11.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promised &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2001/2001_03/#08&#34;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; to 
spew forth some of my thoughts about arguments for the existence of God.  
Let me start by quoting you some of Alex Messer&#39;s summaries of the 
classical Wittgensteinian position about belief in God.  It all comes from 
his &lt;a 
href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198269714/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Does 
God&#39;s Existence Need Proof?&lt;/a&gt;  Here are his nice summaries of the position:
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;God is inexpressible&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Wittgensteinian school is wholly opposed not only to the traditional 
definition of God, but also the whole idea of any definition of God.  
Defining God brings him within the boundaries of language rather than 
allowing him his proper place on the boundaries.  To express God is to fail 
to give due respect to the inexpressible.
&lt;p&gt;
page 22
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;God is not an existent or a being&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Wittgensteinian school is concerned to show the grammatical 
inappropriateness of treating God (as traditional philosophy has done) as 
an existent among existents.  Phillips, for example, often quotes 
Kierkegaard&#39;s dictum, &#39;God does not exist; he is eternal&#39;, with approval.  
The point is that to tread God as an existent is to imply that God might 
not have existed, and this is clearly not what believers have wanted to 
say at all.  For any existing thing, it makes sense to suppose that it 
might not have existed.  All people depend upon their parents having met, 
and their grandparents, and so on.  All living creatures are equally 
dependent.    All man-made objects depend for their existence upon 
geographical, geological, and biological factors.  The point is that it is 
to impose an alien grammar upon God to bring him within this realm of 
discourse.  God does not depend for his existence upon anything else; 
therefore he cannot be described as an existent ot being.
&lt;p&gt;
pages 23 and 24
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;God is not a matter of fact&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is just as grammatically confused to treat God as a fact as to treat 
God as an existent, and for the same reason.  Facts are contingent: they 
are true, but they might not have been.  God, however, cannot be spoken of 
as existing contingently, and this means that we cannot speak of God&#39;s 
reality as factual.  Facts can change: we can come to find that, because of 
new evidence, what we thought of as a fact was mistaken.  Yet it makes no 
sense to say that belief in God was mistaken because new facts have been 
discovered to show this.  To come to believe in God ... is not to discover 
a new fact -- that there is a God -- but to change one&#39;s life in a 
fundamental and practical manner.
&lt;p&gt;
page 25
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;God is practical, not hypothetical&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Wittgensteinian school rejects the notion that God is an explanation 
of life in the way that a hypothesis is.  If new evidence tomes to light 
to show that the Big Bang theory, or neo-Darwinian evolution, is true, 
this does not alter the genuine religious belief in God.  God is not an 
explanation, because God is not in competition with any explanatory 
theory.  Losing belief in God because of scientific advance reveals an 
inadequate conception of God.
&lt;p&gt;
Similarly, genuine belief in God is not hypothetical or theoretical.  To 
treat God as a hypothesis is to believe in God tentatively; new evidence 
could arise at any time to show that our hypothesis was mistaken.  We 
woulld have to check scientific and philosophical journals regularly to 
ensure that our belief in God was stil rational.
&lt;p&gt;
pages 25 and 26
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;God is not an inference, but a presupposition&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For a Proof of God to be an appropriate task, it must be grammatically and 
religiously acceptable to be able to treat God, at least in part, as an 
inference from an idea of unsurpassable perfection, facts about the world, 
or the existence of the world itself.  Phillips opposes such a view by 
arguing that God is an ungrounded presupposition in the believer&#39;s 
world-view.  God is not to be inferred, but things are to be inferred from 
God.
&lt;p&gt;
God, for Wittgenstein, is a measure or a yardstick, not something to be 
inferred from some other measure such as philosophical reasoning.  Belief 
in God is the undergirding of a way of looking at the world, not the result 
of simply looking at the world and trying to explain it.  Religious belief 
is too fundamental and all-encompassing to be able to base it upon 
external factors.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, I think I disagree with just about &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; here.  I&#39;ll 
explain why soon.  I&#39;ll let you chew on it for a little while.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;10&#34;&gt;2001/03/10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;Time for a quick reconfigure of this site: I got sick of the green.  The colour is now officially in the pictures, not in the background.  Two more changes to this place are in the works, but for the moment I&#39;m having more fun preparing classes and teaching them.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/&#34;&gt;Tim Chow&lt;/a&gt; has written a neat exposition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/mathstuff/forcingdum&#34;&gt;forcing for dummies&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s a misnomer.  It&#39;s forcing for those who know what &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt2.html&#34;&gt;Zermelo-Fraenkel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/3/0,5716,117513+9,00.html&#34;&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Math/Logic_and_Foundations/Set_Theory/&#34;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; is, and who have probably seen a forcing proof before, and who want to get a feel for Cohen&#39;s forcing proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis from the ZF axioms.  That&#39;s me.  So I think this short essay is the bee&#39;s knees.&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;09&#34;&gt;2001/03/09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-09.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, after four hours of teaching, two with honours students, and two with second level logic students, I have remembered why I love this job.

Some &lt;em&gt;mathematics&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;p&gt;
In mathematical circles, there is the overall opinion that formulae, in their capacity of syntactic units, are dead things, and that formula manipulation tears the heart out of mathematics. In these circles, formulae largely live by virtue of what they stand for, of what they mean, of how they feel and appeal to our intuition—our(?) intuition? And their meanings then tell which formulae to consider next. Poor Leibniz, poor Lagrange, poor Boole, poor Hilbert, and all others who shifted their attention
towards uninterpreted formulae manipulation: they were all wrong, weren’t they?
&lt;p&gt;

I&#39;ve been thinking and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198269714/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; a bit about the role of proofs of the existence of God.

I&#39;ve had a few attempts at anonymous ftp into this box in the last few days.  The latest is from the kind folks at 64-6-171-199.slc1.phoenixdsl.net according to the logs.  Hi guys!  Sorry, &lt;a href=&#34;ftp://consequently.org&#34;&gt;I don&#39;t do anonymous ftp&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asis.gov.au/recruitment.htm&#34;&gt;This entry&lt;/a&gt; is here just in case I decide I need a career change.   
&lt;p&gt;
However, I&#39;m happy where I am at present, and frankly, a move to spying for Australia is not an option.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asis.gov.au/&#34;&gt;ASIS&lt;/a&gt; probably already know about that meeting of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iso.org.au/&#34;&gt;International Socialists&lt;/a&gt; I went to as an undergraduate.  That will rule me out.
&lt;p&gt;
My brief flirtation with organised socialism was pretty revealing.  The socialists were &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better at following up interested students than the Christian groups on campus (probably because of having to deal with a smaller level of interest in conservative Queensland).  I think that my mother more than just a little freaked out when the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?client=googlet&amp;amp;q=ian%20rintoul%20international%20socialists&#34;&gt;notorious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.parliament.qld.gov.au/handocs/1991.pdf/910226ha.pdf+ian+rintoul+international+socialists&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=googlet&#34;&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marxmail.org/archives/december98/sects.htm&#34;&gt;Rintoul&lt;/a&gt; and an associate paid me a visit.  It was the Sunday afternoon immediately after the evangelistic &#34;What is Socialism?&#34; meeting I attended to check out other student groups on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;campus&lt;/a&gt;. They spent a quick 15 minutes over coffee guaging my interest and possible commitment to the cause.
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, if &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asis.gov.au/&#34;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt; didn&#39;t know of that meeting back then, they probably do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;06&#34;&gt;2001/03/06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pouring rain last night, and as a result, Macquarie University (and this website) is cut off from the outside world for seven hours (from 1:30am to 8:30am).

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moby-online.com/&#34;&gt;Moby&lt;/a&gt; is remarkably articulate.  I was aware of his liner-note discourses encouraging vegetarianism, left-leaning politics and his love for Jesus.  I wasn&#39;t aware that he has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://data.moby-online.com/scripts/moby/viewalldiary.asp&#34;&gt;online diary&lt;/a&gt;.  (The &lt;a href=&#34;http://data.moby-online.com/scripts/moby/viewdiary.asp?Diary_ID=19&amp;amp;ViewType=Current&#34;&gt;jabs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://data.moby-online.com/scripts/moby/viewdiary.asp?Diary_ID=21&amp;amp;ViewType=Current&#34;&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://data.moby-online.com/scripts/moby/viewdiary.asp?Diary_ID=26&amp;amp;ViewType=Current&#34;&gt;W&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://data.moby-online.com/scripts/moby/viewdiary.asp?Diary_ID=45&amp;amp;ViewType=Current&#34;&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; are to die for.) &lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;05&#34;&gt;2001/03/05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-05.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that I can add &lt;em&gt;grantsmanship&lt;/em&gt; to my list of recently acquired skills.  I helped (with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff.htm#Catriona%20Mackenzie&#34;&gt;Head of Department&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/pmenzies&#34;&gt;another colleague&lt;/a&gt;) acquire $49,000 for the department in teaching development funds.  I hate grant interview meetings, but in this case the outcome (a salary for a new member of staff for a year) is worth it.

Read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ftrain.com/rahin_hill_chapel_prayer.html&#34;&gt;Scott Rahin on &lt;em&gt;Being Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Good.  Very good.   Like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ftrain.com/about_views_toc.html&#34;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ftrain.com/about_pef.html&#34;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ftrain.com/about_pef_real.html&#34;&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ftrain.com/&#34;&gt;Ftrain.com&lt;/a&gt;, it repays reading and rereading.

What should I do there in my free time? 
&lt;p&gt;
Here is the measly collection of links I&#39;ve managed to find so far.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The &lt;a href=&#34;http://directory.google.com/Top/Regional/Europe/Finland/Localities/Helsinki/&#34;&gt;Google Helsinki Directory&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Helsinki&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hel.fi/english/&#34;&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldtravelguide.net/cityguide/data/Helsinki/Do&#39;sandDont&#39;s.asp&#34;&gt;What to do in Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://travel.roughguides.com/content/13676/index.htm&#34;&gt;Rough Guide to Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dazle.freeserve.co.uk/&#34;&gt;The Hedgehog Helsinki Travel/Study Guide&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldroom.com/pages/cg_helsinki/hel_main.phtml&#34;&gt;The Helsinki Page at Worldroom.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
These are all instituitional.  They tell you the &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; story.  If you have any &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; information, please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:greg@consequently.org&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.   Where should I hang out?  What should I look out for?  What is distinctively &lt;em&gt;Helsinki&lt;/em&gt;?

The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bridgeclimb.com/&#34;&gt;bridge climb&lt;/a&gt; last night was an experience.  A highly recommended one.  There&#39;s no difficulty at all, and absolutely no danger.  It was less edgy than I would have liked; probably because your focal length is foreshortened at night.  (We were at the summit at approximately 8:45).  A daytime climb would give you a greater sense of depth of field.  Perhaps I will do that in approximately thirteen years&#39; time, if the company running it is still operating then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;02&#34;&gt;2001/03/02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not only is Neale &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/&#34;&gt;wrongwaygoback&lt;/a&gt;, he&#39;s also writing some very good material.  If you&#39;re a publisher, please consider &lt;em&gt;showing him the money&lt;/em&gt;.

Ooof.  Got into the office this morning to encounter my cube suffering a kernal panic.  Estimated time, according to the logs, anything between 3am and 8am.  (Expect occasional outages like this while I figure out how to keep it up and running.  Luckily for you and me, this website is not a matter of life and death.)

More interesting writing, bending the form of the weblog, is to be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medianstrip.net/dotblog/&#34;&gt;medianstrip.net/dotblog&lt;/a&gt;.  Scroll right ---&amp;gt;&lt;H3&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;2001/03/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/2001-03-01.jpg &#34;width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new home on the web.   The &lt;a href=&#34;?x=about&#34;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt; should
give you an idea of how it works.  
&lt;p&gt;
As with all new designs, there&#39;s the risk that I&#39;ve coded something which doesn&#39;t render properly in your browser.  If this is the case for you, please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:greg@consequently.org&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.

I got off the bus this morning and walked to my building, to see (from the outside) that I&#39;d left my office window wide open.  There was a on metre square of air between my seventh-floor office desk and computer and the outside world.  There was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0103/01/national/national11.html&#34;&gt;violent storm yesterday late afternoon and evening&lt;/a&gt; after I had left work.  
&lt;p&gt;
At least I knew from last night that my computer was still working.  I waited to see the state of the rest of the desk as I took the lift up the building.
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s dried out, at least.

     That&#39;s all folks!  This is my last post here using blogger.  Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be somewhere else entirely.  I&#39;ll let you know then.  The year from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_03_01_archive.html&#34;&gt;March 2000&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2001_02_01_archive.html&#34;&gt;February 2001&lt;/a&gt; has been one thing.

&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of changes, go explore the archives of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://laboratorium.net/&#34;&gt;laboratorium&lt;/a&gt;, and wonder what Jason will dream up next.

     I am back.  I am tired, stressed, and I have a pile of things to do, but I&#39;m back, slowly working through them.  Attention to this website is rather low on the list, so expect activity here to be rather sporadic for a short while.  
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/ecq/election01/election01s.html&#34;&gt;2001 Queensland Election&lt;/a&gt; was fun to witness.  (Go &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/ecq/election01/cand/cand217.html&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;!)  It&#39;s surprising when a conservative federal MP &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/news/qldelection/eqld-19feb2001-4.htm&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the stunning victory by the ALP was the best possible outcome, but then, politics is never completely straightforward in Queensland.

     &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/HarbourBridge.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/HarbourBridgeSm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[A Bridge]&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This last week has been one of reorientation.  Not only have I been able to throw out one and a half large bins of paper from my office, but almost all things which need filing have been filed, and almost all things which need doing have been ... well, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of them have been done, and the rest have been put on my list of things to do.   This list now contains over 50 items, but at least they&#39;re where I can see them, instead of languishing around in my office waiting to scare me when I tip over a pile of papers under which they&#39;ve been ignored.
&lt;p&gt;
The best part was throwing away half of the contents of my filing cabinet (and my large boxes of things to be filed in the filing cabinet whenever I got the time) when I realised that I had copies of these papers neatly filed away on my computer as pdf or postscript or dvi files.  (I&#39;m an academic, I collect papers by other people.  It&#39;s a great way to avoid &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;writing them&lt;/a&gt; yourself.)  Anyway, it&#39;s much more productive for these things to be filed away on my hard disk than filed away in my filing cabinet, because my computer is smart enough to index the disk, and I can search for papers by looking for words I know feature prominently.  (This is in case I forget the author and title of the paper.)   The point is this: I&#39;d like the rest of my filing cabinet to be in my computer too.  To do that, I&#39;d need to scan those papers.  (Or get files for them in some other way, I suppose.)  To scan the papers I&#39;ll need a scanner (not too hard to access) and software.   Here&#39;s where you come in.  I want to know if there&#39;s software which will do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Scan a multiple page paper and produce files identical in layout/pagebreaks/linebreaks/etc
to the original paper.    That is, each page is a real replica of the corresponding page of the paper I&#39;m scanning.  Including the silly technical symbols you&#39;re prone to find in logic papers.  (That&#39;s easy.  An image file is an easy file to create.)
&lt;li&gt; Create a file in a type which is publically documented and will not become obselete in the near future.  So, Postscript and PDF are fine, JPEG too, but Microsoft Word DOC files are not.  (This is easy too,  I think that Adobe Acrobat will do these two for me, scanning papers into pdf.)
&lt;li&gt; At the same time as those requirements, I&#39;d like the text of the paper to be scanned and encoded &lt;em&gt;as text&lt;/em&gt; so that the paper can be indexed along with the rest of the documents on my disk.  I know that this can be done.  The people at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.octavo.com/&#34;&gt;Octavo&lt;/a&gt; have done it in style with old manuscripts.  Is there any way for this to be done affordably by mere mortals such as myself?
&lt;/ul&gt;
Once you&#39;ve answered this question, reward yourself by browsing through this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/&#34;&gt;journal of online opinion&lt;/a&gt;.

     It&#39;s &lt;em&gt;cleaning out the office&lt;/em&gt; week, and I&#39;ve been distracted by piles of student assessment forms from days gone by.  In 1998 I was on the team, teaching &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/PHIL137/&#34;&gt;Critical Thinking&lt;/a&gt; (then called the sexy &lt;em&gt;Reasoning and Logic&lt;/em&gt;, before we did our market research).  One comment says
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although I disliked the subject I thought Greg was a highlight &amp;amp; was a great teacher.  It&#39;s a shame he teaches logic though.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And the next:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shame someone so humorous (lectures were always funny) had to deal with something so sterile and tedious as truth tables.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I even had students happily write that they didn&#39;t fall asleep once on my classes.  1998 was a mixed year.  Students liked me but didn&#39;t like the subject.
&lt;p&gt;
Would I prefer it if they fell in love with the subject, but didn&#39;t like me?

 &lt;h3&gt;Friday, February 02, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#2207119&#34;&gt;8:36 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;2207119&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     There are some things you can truly admit to have learned through years of experience, and my knowledge of vending machines is one of these.  Let me share an experience from yesterday.  
&lt;p&gt;
It was time for my afternoon coffee, and with the &lt;em&gt;Grant Application Writing&lt;/em&gt; going slowly, I felt the strange desire for one of the large chocolate chip biscuits (a &#34;cookie&#34; for you American readers) available from the downstairs vending machine.  So, out of the office I get, and down six flights of stairs to the ground floor of my building to the vending machines.  On the way, I check my wallet.  Two two dollar coins.  I know that the biscuits are $1.60 -- you pay a premium price for those large chunks of chocolate -- so I consider myself well equipped for the vending machine.  A chocolate chip biscuit will be mine.
&lt;p&gt;
Down on the ground floor, in front of the vending machine, spying the bottom right row to check on the supply of chocolate biscuity goodness (check!) I get one $2 coin and put it in the slot.
&lt;p&gt;
It makes its journey, not to the money bin in the machine, but directly to the &lt;em&gt;coin return slot&lt;/em&gt;.  I try it again, after checking that the coin isn&#39;t malformed in any way.  Again, the journey is swift, but my coin is rejected.  I check the machine, and only then do I notice the &#34;correct change required&#34; sign flashing right next to the coin slot.  This makes sense.  If the machine requires correct change today, it will reject a $2 coin, because the $1.60 chocolate biscuit is the most expensive of the delights it holds.  But now I have a problem.  The machine wants exact change.  I have two $2 coins.  I have no other cash.  I want a chocolate chip biscuit.
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, this desire can be met because of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; vending machines in the room.  Next to the confectionary machine with your standard chips, chocolates, and sundry things to much is the dreaded Coca Cola machine.  It will accept $2 coins, but it is notorious for accepting them and giving you nothing in return.  No solace there.  No, my salvation will come from the much despised $1coffee, tea and hot chocolate machine.  The coffee, tea and hot chocolate from the machine is no doubt excerable.  (My coffee is nicely brewing upstairs thankyou very much.)  However, the machine is a necessary step on my journey to fulfilment.  This machine also accepts $2 coins.  So I put in $2.  Then, I decide that I do not want a hot beverage from this machine.  So I press the &#34;reject&#34; button.  The machine thinks.  This person gave me $2.  I must give this person $2 back.  It does.  In the form of two $1 coins.
&lt;p&gt;
Now I am on my way.  I consider putting one $1 coin back in the machine and pressing &#34;reject&#34; again to see if I will get any closer to my goal of getting 60 cents in change, but I think better of it.  Chances are, the machine is filled with $1 coins.   No, I have $1 now, and that is perfectly acceptable to go into my original vending machine.  No in it goes.  Remember this is the machine which thinks you must put in your exact change.  (This is basically a licence for the machine to not give you any change if you put in $1.60 for an item worth $1.50.)  Well, I put in $1, and then press the reject button.  And what do you know?  This machine, which allegedly is running low on small denomination coins and will require exact change, dispenses $1 for me, in five 20 cent coins. 
&lt;p&gt;
Thankyou very much, O gods of vending machines!  Three of these newly dispensed 20s, together with my one $1 coin later, I ascend (in a lift) with my sugar kick for the afternoon.
&lt;p&gt;
The Grant Application still isn&#39;t written.

Lewisham is where I usually get off the train, so the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au/maps/CityRail_Map_3/cityrail_map_3.htm&#34;&gt;rest of the line&lt;/a&gt; from Summer Hill onwards, I&#39;ll &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au/timetables/inner_west/up_m-f/lframe.htm&#34;&gt;leave that for you to explore&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, however, I managed to take the car to work.  Rummaging through the cassettes in the glovebox long ignored though ripe for re-listening since we now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_12_01_archive/#1604444&#34;&gt;have a car&lt;/a&gt; with a useable tape player, I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pastemusic.com/artists/drybones.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which provides today&#39;s lyrics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every now and then I seem to dream these dreams&lt;br&gt;
Where the mute ones speak and the deaf ones sing&lt;br&gt;
Touching that miraculous circumstance&lt;br&gt;
Where the blind ones see and the dry bones dance
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
You can download that song &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pastemusic.com/pasteradio/mp3/MHEARD-DryBonesDance.mp3&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and many more lyrics and details of Mark Heard&#39;s music can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://mhlp.rru.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[(These are entries from my blog from 2000 and early 2001. They were originally hosted on a small server at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;Macquarie University&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the links are dead now, but I have kept them as they are here, for nostalgia&amp;rsquo;s sake.)

     &lt;a name=&#34;2186469&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://keaggy.com/30/&#34;&gt;keaggy.com/30/&lt;/a&gt; is another regular photography project, this time from &lt;a href=&#34;http://keaggy.com/&#34;&gt;Bill Keaggy&lt;/a&gt;.  He&#39;s posting a photo of himself for each day of his 30th year.  (His &lt;a href=&#34;http://keaggy.com/30/0101/12.shtml&#34;&gt;birthday&lt;/a&gt; is one day after mine, curiously enough.)
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

          &lt;a href=&#34;#2182900&#34;&gt;9:58 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;2182900&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/Petersham.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/PetershamSm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Petersham Station]&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;198&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It&#39;s been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0101/31/update/news2.html&#34;&gt;pouring&lt;/a&gt; since 2am, with only an occasional break of 10 minutes or so.  Erasmus woke me up, moaning about the rain, and asking me why it was so noisy on the corrugated iron roof.  She then took a look out the front door, decided that it didn&#39;t look inviting out there, and decided to check if it was fine if she exited out the &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; door instead.  Strangely enough, it was raining there too.
&lt;p&gt;
Keeping up the Phil Agre theme from yesterday, his &lt;a href=&#34;http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/network.html&#34;&gt;Networking on the Network&lt;/a&gt; is a mine of useful information for anyone working in academia.  It&#39;s geared for graduate students, starting off in the wild and exciting prospect of finding their own voice and creating their own projects.  However, it&#39;s worthwhile for any of us in the game: there&#39;s nothing like making the techniques and rules of the project explicit for reflecting on them.  Rummage around in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/network.html#appendix&#34;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; for more to read and inwardly digest.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, January 30, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#2174380&#34;&gt;6:34 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;2174380&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/Stanmore.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/StanmoreSm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Stanmore Station]&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;198&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Monday morning we suffered continuous network outages.  It&#39;s a bit crippling if what you&#39;d planned to do relied on being online.  On Monday afternoon, we were out completely, and connectivity was only restored late Tuesday.  Anyway, I must remember: if there is a storm, there will be network outages at Macquarie.  If there has been rain, there will be a network outage at Macquarie.  In fact, if there is any inclement weather at all, expect network outages.  This might explain your hassles in getting to this page too, as I seem to be able to browse around Macquarie at will, but it&#39;s our connection to the outside world which is as dead as a doornail.  
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, I&#39;m becoming interested in the role of reason and rhetoric (or the lack thereof) in public discourse.  This has been on my mind for some time (do you know how depressing it is, looking up the newspapers for articles reporting extended &lt;em&gt;reasoning&lt;/em&gt;?  This is a regular job, digging up source materials for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/PHIL137/&#34;&gt;Critical Thinking&lt;/a&gt; unit) but the proximate cause is a neat little article by Todd Gitlin in this weekend&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/&#34;&gt;Herald&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/&#34;&gt;Phil Agre&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s material on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/rre.html&#34;&gt;RRE&lt;/a&gt; list is usually helpful, but I&#39;d like more.  If any of you know of a good place to start reading up on this, please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.  Thanks.
&lt;p&gt;
On a different note, get lost (or found) in an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gracecathedral.org/labyrinth/il/index.shtml&#34;&gt;online labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;.  (Actually, it&#39;s very difficult to get lost in a labyrinth, as you will probably notice if you explore this one.)
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Busy morning &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.britax.com.au/Steelcraft/index.html&#34;&gt;pram&lt;/a&gt; shopping, and a more relaxed afternoon at the  &lt;a href=&#34;http://achiew.com/reviews/5.shtml&#34;&gt;Complete Works of Shakespeare (Abridged)&lt;/a&gt;.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Friday, January 26, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#2119912&#34;&gt;8:13 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;2119912&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/Newtown.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/NewtownSm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[The Wall at Newtown Station]&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;198&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0101/23/national/national17.html&#34;&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adc.nsw.gov.au/indig.htm&#34;&gt;Survival Day&lt;/a&gt;, to everyone.  It&#39;s one of those mixed-up sorts of days, where we remember the English conquest of our continent, and all of the good and bad consequences that has.  I&#39;ve written about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive/#273679&#34;&gt;unfinished business&lt;/a&gt; between indigenous Australians and the rest of us elsewhere on these pages.
&lt;p&gt;  
Let me mark this day by pointing to  interesting Australians of times past who helped us &lt;em&gt;fly&lt;/em&gt; in one way or another.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Countless unnamed indigenous Australians refined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s11117.htm&#34;&gt;boomerang&lt;/a&gt; making it a hi-tech aerofoil by years of experimentation and innovation.  Seeing (and &lt;em&gt;hearing!&lt;/em&gt;) these things in flight is an incredible experience.  I have very many happy memories of experimenting with 30cm rulers and rubber bands as a youth, attempting to construct my own approximations.  
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newscientist.com/opinion/opinion.jsp?id=ns22757&#34;&gt;Lawrence Hargrave&lt;/a&gt; experimented with flight in countless crazy ways, at Stanwell Tops, just a few hours south of here in Sydney.  He never managed truly &lt;em&gt;powered&lt;/em&gt; flight, but he helped others on the way.  (He appeared on our old paper 20 dollar note, too.)
&lt;/ul&gt;
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Thursday, January 25, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#2106627&#34;&gt;9:17 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;2106627&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/Macdonaldtown.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/MacdonaldtownSm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Train at Macdonaldtown Station]&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;198&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some bits and pieces before I plunge into a rather busy day.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Philip Greenspun&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.photo.net/&#34;&gt;photo.net&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource for people learning photography or just wanting inspiration.  Try this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.photo.net/architectural/interior&#34;&gt;guide to photographing interior architecture&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Read &lt;a href=&#34;http://enterprise.sct.gu.edu.au/~sctwiseh/&#34;&gt;Howard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sct.gu.edu.au/~sctwiseh/DECB/DECB.html&#34;&gt;reconstruction of the ruin and conquest of Britain from 400 A.D. to 600 A.D.&lt;/a&gt; if you&#39;re into historical sorts of things.  It&#39;s amazing what a physicist can get up to in his spare time.
&lt;li&gt; For those with at least a smattering of biblical background and either the memory, the prospect, or the reality of small children, do read these &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbl-site.org/Newsletter/09_2000/Laws1.htm&#34;&gt;Laws Concerning Food and Drink; Household Principles; Lamentations of the Father&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbl-site.org/&#34;&gt;Society of Biblical Liternature&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbl-site.org/&#34;&gt;Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
This piece has done the rounds around a few sites I read, and people have pointed to it as a good joke.  And it is.  I think it&#39;s more, too.  There&#39;s something interestingly subsersive going on when you recast household mores as biblical law.  Something subversive about the content and significance of those biblical laws. (What are these laws?  They&#39;re the kind of thing God tells us so we can all get along in His household.)  It&#39;s almost believable too, except for when you get to the laws which involve stoning people to death rather than sending them to their bedrooms without any dessert.
&lt;/ul&gt;
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, January 24, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#2096416&#34;&gt;2:07 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;2096416&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alp.org.au/media/0101/kbspuao240101.html&#34;&gt;The University of Australia Online?&lt;/a&gt;  I think it&#39;s great that education is an issue in this year&#39;s election compaign.  I&#39;m not sure that setting up a separate institution focussed on net-based education is the way to go.  (Though more jobs in the higher education sector are welcome in almost any shape or form.)  I&#39;ll be interested to find out more about this, and I look forward to seeing how the debate develops.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

Way too hot to do any thinking or writing, and way too hot to sit in front of a hot little computer.  It&#39;s a pity that at the moment, thinking, writing and sitting in front of a hot little computer is mostly what my job involves.  Any time I attempt to actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; any of this results in the feeling that my skull is filled with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/porridge/&#34;&gt;thick porridge&lt;/a&gt;.  Perhaps some tactical deferral of strenuous effert, involving lying down, reading and merely &lt;em&gt;sneaking up on&lt;/em&gt; thinking will do the trick.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Forget a firm butt; I want my spouse to have long thumbs, because my kids will not be disadvantaged!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then (and only then) read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastcompany.com/online/43/andreessen.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.   (Actually, skip to the end, where the quote is found.)

What might have more general interest is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.accessone.com/~trcole/hackett/quotes/quotes.html&#34;&gt;collection of quotes&lt;/a&gt; found on the site.  Let me ask you: why does a cult of personality develop around some academics and not others?
&lt;p&gt;
(I&#39;d certainly be flattered if someone made a list of the in-class jokes I told, but more to the point, I would have a burning desire take them out the back and shoot them.)

(A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2001_01_01_archive/#1923117&#34;&gt;birthday&lt;/a&gt; present).  I&#39;ve been enjoying taking pictures with it in the last few days.  I was never a great picture-taker with my little autofocus 35mm camera.  I think I know why I enjoy the digital camera much more: it&#39;s the near instant feedback.   I never shot a roll of film and got it developed within the week.  It was at least a month between the first shot in a roll of film and when I eventually saw the result.  Now I can see the result in minutes.  I can shoot at will, whatever I feel like, knowing that the only cost is the battery driving the camera.  If it is a botched shot, I won&#39;t even save it on my disk.  If it&#39;s passable, I&#39;ll save it.  
&lt;p&gt;
Now I&#39;m getting inspired by other &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acute.org/red/&#34;&gt;weblogs&lt;/a&gt; that use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lightningfield.com/&#34;&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt; regularly.  There&#39;s heaps to learn, and many interesting ways to be creative with it.

vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Please forgive me for a small cricket-related rant.  Take reading this as an exercise in cultural
anthropology if you don&#39;t have the right background to understand what follows.
&lt;p&gt;
So, Peter Roebuck 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0101/18/sport/sport8.html&#34;&gt;thinks&lt;/a&gt;, as I do,
that one day cricket is boring.  OK, he didn&#39;t just say that it&#39;s boring, he
said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ... it was a little bloodless. Spectators want red meat not
desiccated chicken. They want to see intemperate Vikings striding around the
field in search of blood and mayhem. They want to see danger and risk and
surprises. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
He points out that the middle of the game is completely
predictable: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; Everyone knows the path an innings will take,
especially between overs 15 and 40. And the solution is simple. Cut them out.
Scriptwriters reject patches that hang heavy on an audience, a composer crosses
out movements that fall flat, a songster prunes verses that fail to ignite,
except in national anthems. Cricket must follow suit. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Let&#39;s see this happen.  Roebuck&#39;s solution is to get one-day games over in &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; a
day.  25 overs for each side. 
&lt;p&gt;
I say, let&#39;s take things even further.  Why not make it seven-a-side?  (That would give the fielding 
team rather more to do, and scoring would be easier.  It would also make thowing away a wicket less 
appealing in a 25 over game.)  And then limit bowlers to 5 overs each.  (Yes, that means that at least
5 out of 7 in your team would have to bowl.  How about that?)  That would make
selecting the team rather more difficult, and would certainly force selectors,
captains and teams to be a bit more creative.  We all know that one-day cricket is a game 
for all-rounders, so let&#39;s take this to an extreme.  It&#39;s not Test cricket, so let&#39;s make 
it an interesting game in its own right. 
&lt;p&gt;
There.  I feel better now.   To quote another sporting/marketing phrase.  
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.afl.com.au/&#34;&gt;I&#39;d like to see that&lt;/a&gt;.

(I suppose that should be &lt;em&gt;21st&lt;/em&gt; Century too, sometime soon.)  You can browse ECM&#39;s catalogue at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecmrecords.com/&#34;&gt;their own site&lt;/a&gt; (and I&#39;ve done so for the last three years or so), but the tie-in with Amazon gives you the additional insight of listener reviews.  Go and explore at your leisure.  ECM music is consistently enjoyable.  My way in has been through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/62285/107-3415374-3143701&#34;&gt;P&amp;auml;rt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/64484/107-3415374-3143701&#34;&gt;Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#39;ll be exploring their catalogue a lot more in the future.

     Seen in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16103.html&#34;&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;: &#34;The average child sees an estimated 200,000 violent acts on TV by the time they reach 18-years-old.&#34;
&lt;p&gt;
According to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/issues/current/rfull/poa00191.html&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; referred to in that article,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An intervention to reduce television, videotape, and video game use decreases aggressive behavior in elementary schoolchildren. These findings support the causal influences of these media on aggression and the potential benefits of reducing children&#39;s media use.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That&#39;s an interesting finding.  I&#39;d be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; interested if there were a more comprehensive story indicating &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; exposure to media influences violent behaviour.  After all, there could be many different causal stories to tell, just as there are many different kinds of violence: there is violence as imitation; violence as a part of acquiring or defending scarce resources; violence as a factor in bullying or scapegoating; violence as a show of strength; violence simply as a part of sport or play (some of the football I played as a youth was undoubtedly &lt;em&gt;violent&lt;/em&gt; but it wasn&#39;t any of the other kinds of violence I&#39;ve described, for the most part).  For each different kind of violent act, media consumption could conceivably have a different role to play.  It&#39;s not a trivial issue at all, and it&#39;s one I&#39;d love to know more about.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;On this topic&lt;/em&gt;: I&#39;ve found Gil Bailie&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0824516451/&#34;&gt;Violence Unveiled&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0824516346/&#34;&gt;Rene Girard&#39;s work&lt;/a&gt; useful and thought provoking.  But they&#39;re just a start to understanding how violence works.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     To be sure, this is not a philosophy to be undertaken on my own power.  That power has already been abandoned in despair.  It is rather a philosophy to be practiced by Other-power, which has turned me in a completely new direction through metanoesis [repentance of thought], and has induced me to make a fresh start from the realisation of my utter helplessness... This Other-power brings about a conversion in me that heads me in a new direction along a path hitherto unknown to me...  This is what I am calling &#39;metanoetics&#39;, the philosophy of Other-power.  I have died to philosophy and been resurrected by &lt;em&gt;zange&lt;/em&gt; [repentance].  It is not a question of simply carrying on the same philosophy I had abandoned in my despair, as if resuming a journey after a temporary interruption.  It cannot be a mere repetition without negation and change.  In the life of the spirit, &#39;repetition&#39; must mean self-transcendence; &#39;resurrection&#39; must mean regeneration to a new life.

     Each time I take a trip to or from the train station, the corner shop, the post office or the local caf&amp;eacute;, my walk is punctuated by loud barking when I pass a particular door at the house on the corner of my street and the next road.  This is not just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; barking.  It is not the affectionate &#34;hi-I&#39;m-here-play-with-me-do-you-have-any-food-I-want-to-be-your-friend&#34; barking of a well-adjusted canine.  No, this is aggravated barking.  The kind of barking which can come only from a seriously agitated dog.  An inordinately disturbed dog.  A dog who lives locked up in a tiny backyard behind a terrace house.  A dog whose only opportunity for contact with the outside world is the one centimetre gap betwen the ever-locked gate and the footpath.
&lt;p&gt;
What does this dog look like?  I have no idea.  What does this dog&#39;s &lt;em&gt;nose&lt;/em&gt; look like?  It looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/CanineNose.jpg&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.

Here&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/ErasmusObservant.jpg&#34;&gt;Erasmus&lt;/a&gt; stretching and on the lookout for something to for the rest of the morning.  I took the shot as I left for work a couple of hours ago.

     Tomorrow, I turn a power of two (in years) again.  &lt;em&gt;Last&lt;/em&gt; time was 16 years ago. &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt; time will hopefully be 32 years hence.  Then my first child will hopefully be the age I am now, and the world will be a different place.  Powers of two poingant like that.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
from the flash of conception&lt;br /&gt;
to the flowers on the grave&lt;br /&gt;
from the joy of a birth to the coming of age&lt;br /&gt;
from the freedom of the schoolyard&lt;br /&gt;
to the man at his work&lt;br /&gt;
from the safety of a mother&#39;s arms&lt;br /&gt;
to the ends of the earth&lt;br /&gt;
we walk on&lt;p&gt;

we walk on through the darkness&lt;br /&gt;
we walk on toward the light&lt;br /&gt;
through the confusion and illusion&lt;br /&gt;
through the floods and the fire&lt;br /&gt;
we walk back to the future&lt;br /&gt;
walk away from the flame&lt;br /&gt;
we walk back to the beginning&lt;br /&gt;
where we&#39;re given a new name&lt;br /&gt;
we walk on
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That&#39;s from &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.earthlink.net/~mrmando/tonio_k/Lyrics/olelyrics.htm&#34;&gt;Ol&amp;eacute;&lt;/a&gt; by Tonio K.  Randomly, but appropriately, chosen for me this minute by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.

          &lt;a href=&#34;#1885324&#34;&gt;11:25 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1885324&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Before descending into the depths of sleep, most nights I&#39;ve been reading short slabs of Jared Diamond&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/970615.15shreevt.html&#34;&gt;Guns, Germs and Steel&lt;/a&gt;.  Diamond argues that historical differences between &#34;development&#34; of human societies in Eurasia, Africa, the Americas, Australia and Oceania is to be explained by a combination of factors: geography, and the availability of different plant and animal species.  The point is that these factors explain differential human social structures better than positing an undiscovered genetic difference between so called &#34;races&#34;.  It&#39;s good reading and quite thought provoking (though I agree with Danny Yee that &lt;a href=&#34;http://dannyreviews.com/h/Guns_Germs_Steel.html&#34;&gt;the discussion of religion is unsatisfactory&lt;/a&gt;).  Why did the human culture of intense food production and cultural diversification arise earliest in the aptly-named fertile crescent, and then reach north to Europe and Asia?  Why did the descendents of those cultures spread across the globe?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317552/&#34;&gt;Read the book&lt;/a&gt; to get a hint of how the story might have gone, and why.  

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m reminded of the best in that &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; tradition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/hist-mat/&#34;&gt;historical materialism&lt;/a&gt;: pay close attention to the stuff of history, the very stuff of the means of production upon which a society is based.  After all, if we don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;eat&lt;/em&gt; we don&#39;t contribute to most of the other beautiful and terrible things a human culture can create.
&lt;p&gt;
P.S.  Since when does describing something as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0393317552/customer-reviews/&#34;&gt;politically correct&lt;/a&gt; count as a reasoned criticism of it?  (Reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0393317552/customer-reviews/&#34;&gt;Amazon Reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the book is an insight into a lot of disaffection in middle America and similar cultures.)

Fancy a tour from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-aus.cricket.org/link_to_database/NATIONAL/ICC_MEMBERS/AUSTRIA/&#34;&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; team?  &lt;em&gt;Australia&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;Austria&lt;/em&gt;.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2001_01_01_archive/#1849423&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; didn&#39;t go according to plan.  I should have known that I&#39;m not &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_06_01_archive/#314449&#34;&gt;temprementally suited&lt;/a&gt; to going down a list of things to do.  No, simply &lt;em&gt;avoiding&lt;/em&gt; the worst of the niggly jobs I&#39;ve done rather more than I expected.  I&#39;ve booked tradesmen, I&#39;ve washed floors, I&#39;ve cooked a lovely lunch, I&#39;ve wrangled with a bank on the telephone, I&#39;ve sorted files, I&#39;ve talked to a new Ph.D. student, and I&#39;ve written a budget.
&lt;p&gt;
No, I haven&#39;t done the niggly things I planned to do.  But upon reflection, I&#39;ve done quite a few other niggly things too.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Today is a day for avoiding avoidance.  For putting off procrastination until tomorrow.  In other words, for getting all of those little niggly jobs which need doing, &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;.  This is not particularly enjoyable in the prospect, but upon reflection, it will be good to be over it once this batch is done.

It&#39;s currently 7 pages, out of around 100 or so, so I&#39;m going OK.  It would be better if a more of those pages were &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to &lt;em&gt;bibliography&lt;/em&gt;, but it&#39;s a start.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ll post regular &#34;length&#34; updates to keep me honest with how much writing I get done.

&lt;p&gt;
See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centenary.gov.au/resources/media_centre/media.php?goodwill_id=0&#34;&gt;list of birthday wishes&lt;/a&gt; people have sent us.  Most of them are rather generic, diplomat-speak.  The best I&#39;ve found was from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centenary.gov.au/resources/media_centre/media.php?goodwill_id=48&#34;&gt;The Captains-Regent of the Republic of San Marino&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Captains-Regent of the Republic of San Marino send warmest wishes to Australia for the Centenary of the Federation celebrations and hope that Australia will long continue to enjoy peace, democracy and justice.
&lt;p&gt;
The Regency joins the unanimous chorus of countries that recognise the primacy of law and the principles of tolerance and commitment as the foundations of the most modern societies and conveys to the Australian people the deepest gratitude of the people of San Marino for the clear example the Federation of Australia has set as a model of peaceful development.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Notable omissions are &lt;em&gt;Indonesia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Iraq&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Israel&lt;/em&gt; (but there&#39;s a nice &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centenary.gov.au/resources/media_centre/media.php?goodwill_id=23&#34;&gt;note from Iran&lt;/a&gt;) and as far as I can see, none of the Carribean nations sent a greeting card.  Perhaps they&#39;re &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-aus.cricket.org/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2000/DEC/068807_CI_30DEC2000.html&#34;&gt;smarting from the recent cricket results&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[(These are entries from my blog from 2000 and early 2001. They were originally hosted on a small server at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;Macquarie University&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the links are dead now, but I have kept them as they are here, for nostalgia&amp;rsquo;s sake.)

 &lt;h3&gt;Friday, December 22, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;1736260&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/200010/fea-casselman.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/Descartes.gif&#34; alt=&#34;[Descartes triangulating]&#34; width=&#34;426&#34; height=&#34;358&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/&#34;&gt;parting gift&lt;/a&gt;.  Spend those lazy summer Christmas days reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/200007/fea-grattan.pdf&#34;&gt;wonderful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/199907/fea-cartan.pdf&#34;&gt;expository&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/200010/fea-casselman.pdf&#34;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/&#34;&gt;Notices of the American Mathematical Society&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
This is a parting gift, because I&#39;ll be taking a week or two&#39;s sabbatical from surfing the web over this Christmas break.
&lt;p&gt;
Less time web browsing means more time &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1BCBQOXGSX906&#34;&gt;reading and listening to music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/recipes.htm&#34;&gt;cooking and entertaining&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-aus.cricket.org/&#34;&gt;melting in front of the cricket, in the heat&lt;/a&gt;, and generally enjoying being with friends and family.  I hope your Christmas/Solstice/Hannukah/whatever else is just as refreshing.   See you in 2001.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1735674&#34;&gt;12:46 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1735674&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s name is often &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2-54480,00.html&#34;&gt;misspelled&lt;/a&gt;.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1733713&#34;&gt;9:01 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1733713&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Wisdom, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/&#34;&gt;Brenda&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/2000_12_17_archive/#1732199&#34;&gt;Good mathematics, like good cinema, must leave something to the imagination.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is handy to know, as I&#39;m meant to be spending this week rewriting my unit notes for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/ug/281/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  And yes, Brenda&#39;s statement is relevant, because about 50% of this unit is straight &lt;em&gt;mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, despite the &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt; tag the units get.  For example,  I&#39;ll be helping my students absorbe and understand two or three &lt;em&gt;completeness theorems&lt;/em&gt;, which are reasonably heavy-duty mathematical results.  
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s always a struggle to formulate the best way to introduce new concepts and techniques, but the look on students&#39; faces as they &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt; is more than adequate recompense.   (Well, together with the salary I take home.)
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shlrc.mq.edu.au/queen.html&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from my colleagues in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shlrc.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Speech, Hearing and Language Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; has received a good deal of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/arts-21dec2000-1.htm&#34;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://theaustralian.com.au/common/story_page/0,4511,1540158%255E2702,00.html&#34;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;.

     Are you finding it difficult to get your hands on a Playstation 2?  Could &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.upside.com/Executive_Briefing/3a3ff9ca1.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; be why?
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, December 20, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1718524&#34;&gt;8:37 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1718524&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Here&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/science/planet/house/default.htm&#34;&gt;the house that Mike and Heather built&lt;/a&gt;: the story of how a family renovated an inner Sydney terrace to ensure that it used its own power and water, and reuses all of its sewage on site.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/science/planet/house/links.htm&#34;&gt;links page&lt;/a&gt; on that site has pointers to other sustainable houses.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1718481&#34;&gt;8:24 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1718481&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     More counterfactuals.  Paul Ford at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ftrain.com/&#34;&gt;Ftrain&lt;/a&gt; has us consider this: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ftrain.com/story_possible_wwii.html&#34;&gt;If the Nazis had won, would we have Linux?&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;1712536&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Add my voice to what &lt;a href=&#34;http://grudnuk.com/vm/&#34;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt; about the cabinet reshuffle.  Add to that a general worry about Ms. Vanstone in &lt;em&gt;Family and Community Services&lt;/em&gt;.  Given her &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.monash.edu.au/students/mpa/compass/97/budget.htm&#34;&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt;&#34; in Education, we&#39;ll see how she deals with this poisoned chalice.  (Notice the only position in Cabinet that this government can ever find for a woman is &#34;Family and Community Services&#34;.  Exactly &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; is a woman&#39;s place in this world?)

Hollow Ear has some pointers to explore.  I was drawn there by a search on the Arvo P&amp;auml;rt/Paul Hillier disc, and I&#39;ve stayed for much longer.

     Sometimes a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~mjs/&#34;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; just leaves you hanging.  Has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~mjs/&#34;&gt;he finished&lt;/a&gt;?

     Lisa Reeve from &lt;a href=&#34;http://verybaby.weblogs.com/&#34;&gt;Very Baby&lt;/a&gt; has prompted a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2000/12/13/33549/552&#34;&gt;discussion about online diaries about your child&lt;/a&gt;.  This is not a particularly new phenomenon, with autobiography being a long-lived literary form.  But &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; web page is rather further away from autobiography than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weblogs.com/&#34;&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitas.com/&#34;&gt;frequently-updated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diaryland.com/&#34;&gt;personal sites&lt;/a&gt;.  I use it to keep a track of what I find online.  Through that, you might find out something about me, but that&#39;s not the aim.  It&#39;s much more fun to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in person, over a cup of coffee.

It&#39;s clearly time to brush up on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/yvonne/www/index2.html&#34;&gt;blackboard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msri.org/activities/jir/bhayes/aftermath.html&#34;&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;p&gt;
Even the eminent Gian-Carlo Rota &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html#blackboard&#34;&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; that blackboard technique is an important but unsung art.  Rota&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html&#34;&gt;other lessons&lt;/a&gt; are also food for thought.

     I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; today is a research day, once I get the tedious administration done with.  So, no posts today while I do &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cwi.nl/htbin/uncgi/findreport?Author=rutten&amp;amp;CASE=-i&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/CWIreports/AP/CS-R9241.ps.Z&#34;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;.

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://slate.msn.com/framegame/entries/00-12-07_94796.asp&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful collection of pieces of reasoning.  An example distilled from some current US political rhetoric:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The electorate gave half its mandate to Bush and half to Gore. You are a member of the electorate. Therefore, you gave half your mandate to Bush and half to Gore. Therefore, you voted for an agenda that is not centered around a party philosophy. Bush&#39;s agenda is not centered around a party philosophy. Therefore, you voted for Bush&#39;s agenda. Bush&#39;s agenda includes tax cuts and partial privatization of Social Security. Therefore, you voted for tax cuts and partial privatization of Social Security.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The fact that the actual &lt;em&gt;reasoning&lt;/em&gt; contained in so much political rhetoric is so &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; should make you think that something else is going on in that kind of talk.  What ever it is, it isn&#39;t the giving of reasons, it&#39;s not dialogue, and it&#39;s not clarifying issues.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We even managed to beat the dealer down significantly on price, and to accept our decrepit car as a trade-in.  We pick it up on Tuesday.  Our only constraint was that we&#39;d buy it if it was in decent working order, and if they&#39;d accept our wreck of a car, but when the dealer actually asks you &lt;em&gt;so what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your limit?&lt;/em&gt; you have to name something significantly lower than the price they&#39;re asking for, just to see if they&#39;ll come at it.  And in this case, he did.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m glad the dealer had no idea that I&#39;m terrible at bargaining.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, December 05, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1562406&#34;&gt;9:08 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1562406&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I interrupt this broadcast to present a &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt; for you.  There&#39;ll 
be &lt;em&gt;fame&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fortune&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gratitude&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup 
style=&#34;font-size:80%&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; for you if you can give me a positive 
response.  Here goes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Find a metric space &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; with an uniformly continuous isomorphism 
&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt; to the metric function space &lt;b&gt;[D -&amp;gt; I]&lt;/b&gt; of uniformly 
continuous functions from &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; to the unit interval &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now for some explanations and clarifications:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;: I don&#39;t care what metric you equip the function space &lt;b&gt;[D -&amp;gt; 
I]&lt;/b&gt; with.  What I do care is that it&#39;s the space of all absolutely 
continuous functions from &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; to the unit interval.  And I care that 
the isomorphism &lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt; itself be uniformly continuous too.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;: You might find this question rather similar to what &lt;a 
href=&#34;www.google.com/search?q=domain+theory&#34;&gt;domain theorists&lt;/a&gt; have 
done.  The famous result of Scott is to construct a space &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; 
isomorphic to the space &lt;b&gt;[D -&amp;gt; D]&lt;/b&gt; of continuous functions from 
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; to itself.  This is an ingenious iterative construction.  (And he 
uses it to construct a model of the lambda calculus.)  My inexpert attempt 
at doing the same sort of thing (while on the train on the way home today) 
crashed and burned.  I have no idea if these techniques can be made to work 
for my problem.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Third&lt;/em&gt;: If there&#39;s a nice proof of the existence of such a space, 
there&#39;s a nice explanation of the consistency of a naive theory of classes, 
despite Russell&#39;s paradox.  The trick is turned, as usual, by stuffing 
around with the logic.  (Here it&#39;s Lukasiewicz&#39;s infinitely valued logic 
which is in my sights.)  The nice thing here is that the existence of this 
function space will give us a consistency proof by what are hopefully 
insightful &lt;em&gt;semantic&lt;/em&gt; technqiues, rather than the dry axiom-chopping 
usual for such consistency proofs.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;sup style=&#34;font-size:80%&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Perhaps not in equal quantities.
&lt;p&gt;
I now return you to your previously scheduled programming.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;1545717&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     The magazine inside the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/&#34;&gt;weekend paper&lt;/a&gt; had a few pages on the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582341001/&#34;&gt;Atlas of Experience&lt;/a&gt; by cartographers Jean Klare and Louise van Swaaij.  Words don&#39;t do it justice: it is literally an atlas of human experience.  Pages and pages of maps, covering change, adversity, regret, food (both fast food and haute cuisine), forgetfulness and much much more.  It&#39;s landed on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1BCBQOXGSX906/&#34;&gt;wishlist&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
These maps reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lisson.co.uk/theArtists/Patterson/simonpatterson.html&#34;&gt;Simon Patterson&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Aest/AestFitz.htm&#34;&gt;The Great Bear&lt;/a&gt; which replaces station names on a map of the London Underground with famous personages (so the lines feature &lt;em&gt;Comedians&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Philosophers&lt;/em&gt;, etc, which makes the choice of people at the intersections often a delight).  Why?  It&#39;s the spatial representation of non-spatial relationships.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;1531465&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I have spent a relaxing morning, helping complete the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/&#34;&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/crossword/0012/02/cryptic.html&#34;&gt;cryptic crossword&lt;/a&gt;, and helping consume a rather incredible amount of breakfast, at the delightful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/pbhist.htm&#34;&gt;Parsley Bay&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
For some reason, the crossword online is not the same as the one in the newspaper.  And no, I can usually complete about &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; entry in a cryptic crossword.  (For a starter about how to do these things, and a great Australian Music puzzle, try Adam Spencer&#39;s puzzle for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/ausmusicmonth/crossword/default.htm#hints&#34;&gt;Australian Music Month&lt;/a&gt;.)

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     If I thought &lt;a href=&#34;http://members.tripod.com/~tbonepage/&#34;&gt;T-Bone Burnett&lt;/a&gt; sounded good on those speakers, I had no idea what they could do with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.universalclassics.com/usa/selection.asp?selection_id=2230&#34;&gt;Isle of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course, the massive thunderstorm, combined with the alarms going off all over campus and the faint sounds of sirens in the distance could have had something to do with the general tenor of the afternoon.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

(I had no idea that those teensy speakers could sound so &lt;a href=&#34;http://members.tripod.com/~tbonepage/&#34;&gt;round&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tmtm.com/sam/burnett/criminal.html&#34;&gt;textured&lt;/a&gt;.)  
&lt;p&gt;
One day, when the network people recognise its hardware address, I might use it to browse the web, and once it gets upgraded in memory from its currently poky 64MB to something useable in this day and age, it will get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;decent operating system&lt;/a&gt; and it will become my desktop computer at work.  But for now, it makes a gorgeous desktop stereo.  And that&#39;s OK.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;1506173&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;Today&#39;s revelation&lt;/b&gt;:  This morning, contemplating the break from teaching, I discovered that the writing project I have thoughtfully filed away to do in &lt;em&gt;January&lt;/em&gt; (while sprawled in front of the box watching the cricket on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/grandstand&#34;&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt;, as is my habit) requires roughly 5 pages a day.  For the whole month.  Damn those large &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html#rle&#34;&gt;handbook articles&lt;/a&gt;!  
&lt;p&gt;
Now, it&#39;s a subject I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/&#34;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt;, none of the material is really &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;, I have an outline on paper, and the structure seems sound, so writing it is not exactly jumping into the void.  However, it will require an interesting degree of application to convert the outline into a finished piece of work.
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps this log will take a hiatus over summer.

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vicioso.com/Entertainment/Music/RockNRoll/artists/TonioK/TonioK.html&#34;&gt;Tonio K&lt;/a&gt; does indeed &lt;a href=&#34;http://detnews.com/1997/accent/9710/06/10060069.htm&#34;&gt;define undeserved obscurity&lt;/a&gt;.

     Well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_11_01_archive/#1493313&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; was successful.  The typical academic department power struggle, with the contenders for the Head of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Department&lt;/a&gt; job silently circling each other, thinking &#34;I don&#39;t want to do it&#34;, &#34;Not me&#34; and &#34;Why not her/him?&#34; has come to what at least seems to be successful conclusion.  Perhaps after this transition the Dreaded Job might be a little more manageable, and slightly more attractive.

     Still working.  (Though from home, and not from work.)   At the moment, I&#39;m doing my duty for the profession by refereeing papers.  I should do this in a black mood, because then I&#39;d reject more papers.  But, kindly soul that I can be, I tend to say nice things about them, thus contributing to the flood of publications out there.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;

     Doing the rounds at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metafilter.com/&#34;&gt;Metafilter&lt;/a&gt; is this intruiging picture of &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap001127.html&#34;&gt;Earth at Night&lt;/a&gt;&#34;.   Look at it and join in the fun playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/4470&#34;&gt;spot the social phenomena&lt;/a&gt; you can see represented in the picture.  (Quite striking for me was the difference between North and South Korea.)
&lt;p&gt;
I also liked the fact that the folks at NASA had to &lt;a href=&#34;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap001127.html&#34;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; that this was &#34;actually a composite of hundreds of pictures&#34; made by different satellites.  Well, did anyone &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that the whole globe was in darkness at the same time?

It&#39;s strikingly mature work for a teenager.

     It&#39;s the &lt;em&gt;cricket&lt;/em&gt; season at last.  And despite a rather &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-aus4.cricket.org/link_to_database/NEW/LIVE/frames/WI_AUS_T1_23-27NOV2000.html&#34;&gt;one-sided day&#39;s play&lt;/a&gt;, and the prospect of a one-sided &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-aus4.cricket.org/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/2000-01/WI_IN_AUS/&#34;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s still a distinctive start to the long languid summer for me.
&lt;p&gt;
My favourite feature of the summer these days?  The delightftul, intelligent and passionate commentary of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0011/23/sport/sport3.html&#34;&gt;Peter Roebuck&lt;/a&gt;.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Greg, when you&#39;re getting depressed or listless, check to see how much time you&#39;ve actually spent &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; students.  
&lt;p&gt;
This meditation is brought to you buy the many small moments I&#39;ve recently enjoyed, helping my &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/PHIL134&#34;&gt;intro logic&lt;/a&gt; students understand their material in the run up to today&#39;s exam.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     The new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iht.com/frontpage.html&#34;&gt;International Herald Tribune&lt;/a&gt; website is the way to do newspaper sites online.  Amazing design.  (At least on IE5/Macintosh.  I have do idea how it renders on other browsers.)

     I walked out the door this morning, to see that two roses had been decapitated.  The chief suspect?  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/&#34;&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;, which sails through the air, projected from the newsagent&#39;s car, to land with a resounding thud on our front door at 6:30 each morning.  (Except for Saturday, which features &lt;em&gt;two thuds&lt;/em&gt; -- and perhaps more significant damage to the roses -- and Sunday, which is blessedly thud-free.)

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.regenerator.com/6.3/home.html&#34;&gt;Something&lt;/a&gt; for me to think about:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No child can be truly secure in the hands of parents whose care for him or her is purchased by the neglect of other people&#39;s children.... The only home which is safe for anyone to be born into is the home that is ready to welcome someone who does not belong there by right of kinship, but belongs there in virtue of hospitality.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hmm.

Munching a Big Mac with fries was the antithesis of receiving communion and should be spurned by Catholics&lt;/a&gt;

     I&#39;m stunned by &lt;a href=&#34;http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/cn/20001113/tc/gates_defends_pc_at_comdex_unveils_new_tablet_1.html&#34;&gt;this revelation&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [Microsoft] Tablet PC has a 500 to 600-MHz CPU, 128MB of RAM, a 10GB hard disk, and universal serial bus (USB) ports for keyboard and mouse, said Microsoft software architect Bert Keeley, who demonstrated the tablet during Gates&#39; keynote. It runs Whistler, the next version of Microsoft Windows 2000.
&lt;p&gt;
The Tablet PC can convert handwritten pen strokes into graphics that can be handled in ways similar to ordinary computer type. Although the computer doesn&#39;t recognize specific words, it distinguishes between words and pictures. It also lets people perform some word processing-like tasks, such as inserting space between lines, copying text or boldfacing pen strokes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Surely they can do better than that.  I want my handwritten text to be treated as &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;.  There&#39;s some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_07_01_archive/#533206&#34;&gt;old technology&lt;/a&gt; around which can give them a hand. (I still use that old technology daily on my trusty Newton.)
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I&#39;d just like to say that I love my friends.  I&#39;ve had a really tense week at work (last week of semester, deadlines, meetings, things to do etc.) Two things have helped.  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;, taking a break in the middle of the day, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yogacritic.com/july2000/asana.htm&#34;&gt;lying down, breathing slowly, unwinding, and meditating&lt;/a&gt;.  (It&#39;s an eerie feeling, noticing that headache fade.)  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;, talking with a friend over a cup of coffee.  It&#39;s just as effective.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1375899&#34;&gt;9:08 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1375899&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     And the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.droplift.org/guide.html&#34;&gt;converse of shoplifting is ...&lt;/a&gt;

(I live in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_06_01_archive/#388528&#34;&gt;tradesperson hell&lt;/a&gt;.)

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_11_01_archive.html&#34;&gt;It&lt;/a&gt; was revealing.  The baby seems well.  Spectacularly so, when you see the four-chambered heart regularly beating, and arms and legs waving around.  As Christine was poked and prodded, pushed and pulled, I was slack-jawed, managing only to say &#34;wow&#34;, &#34;that&#39;s incredible&#34; and &#34;isn&#39;t it amazing.&#34;
&lt;p&gt;
Waiting at the train station, we noted that this was probably the only time you get to see amazingly thorough cross-sections of a person.  Or so we hope, for this particular small person.
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, we know the baby&#39;s sex too.  But I&#39;ll write references to the baby in carefully gender-neutral language for those who want a suprise later.  (But feel free to ask me, if you like.  It&#39;s not a secret, or anything.)

is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interesting idea.  Tax cross-border currency transactions at a miniscule amount, resulting in slightly calmed waters of the currency market, and &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of money for international initiatives such as alleviating poverty.  It&#39;s an idea worth campaigning for.

     Xanana Gusmao is a pretty inspiring character when you hear him.  He&#39;s in town to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iidnet.org/apcet/gusmao-awarded-sydney-peace-prize.htm&#34;&gt;receive&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/Arts/departs/cpacs/Events.htm&#34;&gt;Sydney Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; (for some reason, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/Arts/departs/cpacs/cpacmain.htm&#34;&gt;Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies&lt;/a&gt; don&#39;t update their web page, so there&#39;s information there about &lt;em&gt;last year&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s prize).
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, a rebel leader who says that revolutionary guerilla fighters do not necessarily make good heads of state, and who thinks that it would not necessarily be a &lt;em&gt;good idea&lt;/em&gt; for him to be president of a free East Timor, seems to good sense.  He&#39;s got more concern of the well-being of his people than many other leaders in this world.
&lt;p&gt;

It&#39;s fun to find out &lt;a href=&#34;http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/surfer2000.htm&#34;&gt;what&#39;s happening&lt;/a&gt;, but it&#39;s more fun to think about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.nwu.edu/~d_saari/geom/geometry.html&#34;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; of voting.
&lt;p&gt;
(P.S.  I think that each of us who isn&#39;t a U.S. citizen should get roughly 5% of a vote, given how much the decision affects us.  That would make it an &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; race.)
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, November 07, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1291874&#34;&gt;8:04 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1291874&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I&#39;m not as hard on Cauchy as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/2000_11_05_archive/#1277800&#34;&gt;Brenda is&lt;/a&gt;.  It does &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like Cauchy is an arrogant guy when you hear what&#39;s named after him, but as far as I can tell in this game, people almost never name theorems after themselves.  We can blame other parties for that.  
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve taken to calling a wonderful theorem the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/&#34;&gt;Belnap&#39;s Pair Extension Theorem&lt;/a&gt;.  No-one would ever accuse &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~belnap&#34;&gt;Nuel&lt;/a&gt; of arrogantly 
claiming the theorem for himself.  I&#39;d wager that this third parties are overwhelmingly primary source of attributions, and that naming a result after yourself is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; rare.
&lt;p&gt;
Some historian/sociologist of mathematics should do the hard yards and study the nature of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=mathematics+attribution&#34;&gt;attribution&lt;/a&gt; in the mathematical sciences.  I&#39;m no historian, but I think there are a lot of interesting discoveries to be made here.
&lt;p&gt;
As to &lt;em&gt;policy&lt;/em&gt;, I don&#39;t think that dubbing a theorem &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s Theorem is particularly enlightening.  I&#39;d much rather call it &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; Theorem, where &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is descriptive.  That way, if history decides the attribution differently, my attribution to &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; could &#34;wear off&#34;, and people still have some idea of what I was talking about.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;You do know what a &lt;em&gt;Pair Extension&lt;/em&gt; is, don&#39;t you?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Christine it might be an idea to steer clear of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0011/07/pageone/pageone8.html&#34;&gt;Perth beaches&lt;/a&gt; for a while.

Organized religion to me, frankly, is like joining NASA in order to look at the moon.

     Grapefruit juice is good.  I never knew, however, that it interacted with &lt;a href=&#34;http://umcnews.com/askthepharmacist/grapefruitjuice.html&#34;&gt;so many things&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pharmacology.about.com/health/pharmacology/library/weekly/aa000522a.htm&#34;&gt;primer&lt;/a&gt; on the &#34;grapefruit juice effect.&#34;  (The interesting thing for me is the interaction with caffeine.  It seems to increase the absorbtion of many drugs, including caffeine.)

It skirts on the edge of plausibility.  The most shocking line (for me, as I grew up in Queensland):

In full view &amp;amp; televised over national TV, Bjelke-Petersen is shot several times in the head.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I didn&#39;t check after the latest &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/&#34;&gt;redesign&lt;/a&gt;, and the nested tables either slowed down page rendering to a crawl, or broke them completely.  It should be fixed now.  (If it isn&#39;t, please do &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;mail me&lt;/a&gt;, but of course you&#39;re probably not seeing this if it doesn&#39;t work, so that&#39;s one of the more irrelevant imperatives I&#39;ve uttered recently.)

 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, October 31, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1221939&#34;&gt;10:33 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1221939&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Meditate on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/14303.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; interesting snippet:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sun&#39;s chief scientist John Gage told us back in June that he thought one of the biggest headaches in computing in fifty years would be disappearance of the canonical text. He didn&#39;t just mean bit-flipping, as any regular &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.napster.com/&#34;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; user will confirm. 
&lt;p&gt;
Faced with several dozen versions of &lt;em&gt;Heartbreak Hotel&lt;/em&gt;, many of different lengths, recorded at different bitrates, how do you know which version is the definitive recording? Which one drops the start, and adds dead space at the end? At least the central server model ought to guarantee some redundancy. The redundancy in the Napster model is really a redundancy of incompleteness. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then think about what is meant by &lt;em&gt;definitive&lt;/em&gt; in this context.  (Or perhaps more usefully, think about what we &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to mean by &#34;definitive&#34; here.)
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Monday, October 30, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1214734&#34;&gt;3:49 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1214734&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     With this free few minutes between meetings, let me attempt to answer &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/2000_10_01_archive/#1197710&#34;&gt;Russ&#39; Questions for Unbelievers&lt;/a&gt;.  The thought of this is, admittedly, a little odd, because I&#39;m not an unbeliever (at least in Russ&#39; sense).  However, many of my friends are atheists or agnostics, and I think that it&#39;s a useful exercise to see how questions can be answered from different positions.  I also don&#39;t think that Russ&#39; questions are particularly challenging (just as I don&#39;t think that the typical questions posed to religious believers are particularly challenging) and neither are they the important issues facing religious believers or unbelievers.  But, to test my conviction here, I&#39;ll see how I can go in &#34;answering&#34; them in a few minutes time.  Let&#39;s go:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;Prove to me that God doesn’t exist and that my religious experience is false. Are you calling me a liar, or just delusional?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have no desire to prove that you&#39;re mistaken.  I think that you&#39;re mistaken, because I think that there is no god.  I&#39;m not calling you a liar (you&#39;re not intentionally saying untruths) nor delusional in the common psychologically accepted sense.  However,
plenty of religious believers believe plenty of different things, and believe in the existence of mutually incompatible religious entities.
You can&#39;t all be right.  Likely as not, most of you are wrong.  &#34;Delusional&#34; was your word, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;If atheism is the way to go, how do you explain the atrocities committed in its name against religious people: the French Revolution, Stalinist Russia, Maoist China (not to mention postmodern hostility to religion)?&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Well, obviously neither religion nor irreligion makes people moral angels.  More&#39;s the pity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;How can you enforce any laws if there is no objective right or wrong, good or bad? What gives you the right to tell anyone that they cannot do anything? Why should I care about anyone else’s “rights”?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang on: I said that there was no god, not that
there was no right or wrong.  Since when were these necessarily tied?  Furthermore, I think that I can show that they aren&#39;t the same.  Clearly the good isn&#39;t good just because a god says so, for a god might ask you to do something wrong.  Surely if a god asked me to do something abhorrent (such as killing your firstborn) that would still be Wrong, wouldn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;li&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;Speaking of which: how do I know anyone has any rights at all? Isn’t it just the powerful deciding who has what rights?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, how do I know that there&#39;s an external world?  I have no idea.  What?  You&#39;re asking me to be an expert epistemologist?  I have no idea how we know these things.  We just do.  Do you have a problem with that?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;Prove to me that certain rights are “self-evident”.&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Now this is &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; funny!  Surely the point was that these rights are &lt;em&gt;self-evident&lt;/em&gt;.  What, they aren&#39;t evident to you?  That&#39;s a shame.  The whole point of self-evident rights is that they&#39;re obvious.  They&#39;re not to be founded in anything else more fundamental.  You can&#39;t prove them in terms of anything more evident.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;Isn’t the claim that there are no absolutes self-refuting?&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I suppose it is, but whoever said that I was committed to that simply because I deny the existence of gods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; 	&lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;For those of you who believe in “a higher being” or heaven: How does one get to heaven? Who goes to hell? Does the higher being grade on a curve, and where is the cut-off point? If only really bad people like Hitler and Dahmer go to hell, what about people almost as bad as them, but not quite as bad? How bad do you have to be to go to hell? How good do you have to be to go to heaven?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, an atheist or agnostic doen&#39;t have to answer this, but on the behalf of the deists or whoever else cares, presumably a god will do what that god will do.  There are plenty of different policies of judgement depending on what is being judged on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;You tell me that you can’t believe in the God of the Bible or in a God that judges people, but instead that you believe in a God that is loving and tolerant. Why should I believe in this God? Because you made Him up in your own mind and that’s how you want Him to be? On that basis, why shouldn’t I believe in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy?&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Again, answering for a theist of some kind, presumably you can tell this by inspecting the notion of &#34;God&#34;.  What is a &#34;God&#34; if not a morally supreme being, and surely love and tolerance (together with many other things) are bound up in supreme goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;How can you say some people are more valuable than others? Isn’t a double standard that you insist equal rights and dignity to all people regardless of skin color, race or gender, but deny it to others because of their physical health or their point of development in the womb?&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colour me stunned!&lt;/em&gt; Since when does atheism or agnosticism get tied together with discriminatory treatment?  (Presumably theists who burned nonbelievers at the stake weren&#39;t making discriminatory judgements of people&#39;s value?)  Anyway, I see no essential tie between agnosticism or atheism and the issue of abortion.  A nonbeliever can be &#34;pro-life&#34; and a believer can be &#34;pro-choice&#34;.    It&#39;s an issue of the relative rights of the mother and the foetus, and the status of the foetus as a person, and this is completely independent of the existence or otherwise of any supernatural being.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;li&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;Is it better to give the choice of having an abortion to a woman while denying the choice of life to the fetus—and forget that she had exercised her choice before getting pregnant?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the answer to the previous question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;If all religions are really just different ways of reaching God, then aren’t they all wrong since each makes an exclusive claim for the truth?&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I agree entirely.  The problem was?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;Doesn’t atheism (or evolution or big bang or deism) require as much faith as theism? What makes you think your presuppositions are better than mine?&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I said nothing about presuppositions.  However, atheism or agnosticism doesn&#39;t require 
the belief in a supernatural, invisible moral agent, so presumably the answer is &#34;no&#34;.  We don&#39;t need that kind of faith.  As to what other &#34;faith&#34; is required, and whether it 
is &#34;as much as&#34; the faith of religious believers, that depends.  How can you compare amounts of faith anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hlt&#34;&gt;If all we are are intelligent, soulless animals no different than any other animal and we are accountable to no one, then in the end what does it matter if certain members of our species have to sit at the back of the bus?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It matters terribly much to me, in just the same way that it matters to cause pain or suffering to anyone or anything capable of pain or suffering.  I&#39;d much rather treat other human beings well because of the importance of those human beings themselves (contingent fallible creatures that we are) rather than treating them &#34;well&#34; just be cause there&#39;s a Being In the Sky with a Big Stick telling me to.  No, it matters to me that we treat other beings well because they&#39;re other beings, worthy of respect in their own right, not because of anyone or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;  
There.  How did I go?
&lt;p&gt;
I think that these answers are not particularly good, but they&#39;re just as good as the stock standard religious answers to questions religious people get asked.  
&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s the point of this?  Simply that I think that religious discussion ought to get past trivial name calling and asking questions whose sole purpose is to put the other party in a bind.  Why not explore the issues with a generous spirit?  It&#39;s possible that we all might learn something.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     A slight redesign around &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s officially warmer weather now, and I thought I&#39;d cool the page down.  Browns and oranges are for winter warming.  Now some cooler whites, blues and purples for those steamy summery days.  (If you don&#39;t see the change in your browser, just load the updated &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/main.css&#34;&gt;stylesheet&lt;/a&gt; and then reload this page.  An old copy of the stylesheet was left in your cache.)
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, it&#39;s not getting over 20 today and it feels positively autumnal.  Oh well.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#39;s a minimal movie website, and a minimal, affectionate movie about the Australian &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwpks.atnf.csiro.au/&#34;&gt;Parkes Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwpks.atnf.csiro.au/apollo11/&#34;&gt;their involvement&lt;/a&gt; with the Apollo 11 moon landing.   The &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwpks.atnf.csiro.au/&#34;&gt;observatory website&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwpks.atnf.csiro.au/apollo11/&#34;&gt;their story&lt;/a&gt; well.   A nice tidbit:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the signals for the Australian broadcast did not have to travel to Houston (via satellite) and then back again as it did for the rest of the world, Australian audiences saw the pictures some 300 milliseconds (or 0.3 seconds) before the rest of the world did.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The advantages of being directly involved.

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/10/wolfe-jacobs.htm&#34;&gt;Alan Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;: I have found [students at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wheaton.edu/&#34;&gt;Wheaton College&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative Christian liberal arts college] to be particularly engaged by Gadamer, Bakhtin, and Levinas, and by the rabbinical scrupulosity of much of Derrida&#39;s work. They also get a sinister pleasure from reading Foucault, who is after all a kind of Calvinist, only without God -- Michael Warner is right to say that if you think Foucault is suspicious of the human order, try reading Jonathan Edwards. So Foucault is in a weird way one of us.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I spent a not unenjoyable stroll through the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.westfield.com.au/westfield/westfieldbeta.nsf/MediaReleases/4244CBB15D5ABB53CA25693E0023351D?OpenDocument&#34;&gt;Westfield Burwood&lt;/a&gt; at lunch today.  It&#39;s the usual late 20th Century Shopping Extravaganza, but the food court is indeed quite pleasant.  (This is an odd concession from me, as I generally &lt;em&gt;loathe&lt;/em&gt; shopping complexes.)  At first I couldn&#39;t see what made it a pleasant experience, but then I saw it.  The &lt;em&gt;windows&lt;/em&gt; opened the view to the outside world.  You could see the park, and the much-more-interesting caf&amp;amp;eacute;s and pubs and street life below.  You could even open some windows and doors and go out to the baclonies and enjoy the genuine air.  This shopping complex isn&#39;t merely a sterile concrete box shielded from the outside world.  It&#39;s a sterile concrete and glass box from which you can view the outside world.  It&#39;s still a sterile box, but at least you can see your context.
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, and I like to think of the written exhortations to [relax], [enjoy], and above all, to [shop] on the tables in the food court to be playfully ironic.  (I can only hope.)

&lt;p&gt;
Perkins died without seeing real reconciliation between Australia&#39;s indigenous people and its colonisers and immigrants.  We will all die without knowing if what we&#39;ve worked towards will come, or if it will last.  Hopefully, Charlie Perkins&#39; tireless efforts will not prove to have been in vain.

 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, October 18, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1111845&#34;&gt;8:20 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1111845&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I continue to be amazed at how &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt; things seem, depending on emotional tenor and other hard-to-detect factors.  Here is a case in point:  Last Thursday&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/ug/134/&#34;&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; class I&#39;ve ever given in my life.  My train of thought was not merely derailed, it never left the station before grinding to an inglorious halt.  (It&#39;s rather like the train I&#39;m writing this entry on, as a matter of fact. We&#39;re wait outside Ashfield station, letting all the Paralympic Opening Ceremony spectators rush to Strathfield or on to Olympic Park before we get our turn at the station.)  Anyway, was vague, addled, distracted, and positively unhelpful.  I shudder to think of what the students made of it, or if they&#39;ll ever understand the material at all.
&lt;p&gt;
Today&#39;s lecture, on the other hand, felt fantastic.  I was on top of things, I was on fire, preaching it with the best of them. (It&#39;s amazing how passionate you can get about the language of predicate logic.  Quantifiers are beautiful.  But I digress once more.)
&lt;p&gt;
Why were these classes different?  Why was last week generally a complete write-off and why is this week shaping up as a much nicer week to spend seven days in?  The subject matters of my classes were the same.  But last week I was recovering from illness, and I was distracted.  This week I took more time to prepare (once burned, never to be burned again, at least while I remember what a terrible lecture feels like) and I&#39;m more engaged.  I feel more plugged in.  But apart from the facts about preparation (which don&#39;t determine things totally, as I&#39;ve given great unprepared classes, and mediocre prepared ones) this is merely a &lt;em&gt;redescription&lt;/em&gt; of the phenomenon, not an &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
I wonder when the next dip will be, and what I can do to make sure that I never again give the worst class of my life.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1107193&#34;&gt;9:07 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1107193&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     It will be interesting watching the progress of devices like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.handspring.com/products/visorphone/index.jhtml&#34;&gt;Handspring&#39;s Visorphone&lt;/a&gt;.  It seems clear enough to me that some kind of &#34;convergence&#34; of digital devices is coming.  After all, do you think people &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; juggling their PDA, their phone, their portable music player, their digital camera and their gameboy? Imagine just keeping tabs of &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; batteries are running down and where to recharge them all!  
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I&#39;ve forgotten that these digital devices don&#39;t just work to fulfil their explicit functions -- they also have more implicit functions as status symbols.  People don&#39;t buy these things because simply they are useful and they meet pre-existing needs.  We have our needs constructed for us, too.  (A consumer society is no good without compliant consumers, always willing to upgrade.)  Perhaps the need to have a new &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; when the Next Big Thing comes on to the market will work against any to consolidation.  We shall see.
&lt;p&gt;
What do &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want?  I&#39;d make do with a small (pocketable) PDA/Camera/Music-player mix which could send and receive the occasional phone message (affordably) and would wirelessly sychronise its storage with my resources elsewhere on the network.  &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; would be truly useful.  (Especially if it was stylish and available in a choice of colours.)   Of course, I&#39;d try to resist the urge to upgrade when in a year or so the new model with twice the capacity comes out.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     It is nice to see that my reproductive habits (perhaps one child-in-the-making is a lttle much to call a &#34;habit&#34;) are among the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/darkages/&#34;&gt;signs of the end&lt;/a&gt;.

     Well, today&#39;s meetings have been better.  More boring, but much more good-natured.  Perhaps there&#39;s light at the end of the tunnel.

     What was the &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_08_01_archive/#591451&#34;&gt;super-top-secret news&lt;/a&gt;&#34; I mentioned here over two months ago, and of which I promised to tell you &#34;sometime soon&#34;?  It&#39;s that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/staff/parkerc/index.html&#34;&gt;Christine&lt;/a&gt; is pregnant.   We&#39;re in week 15, and all is currently well with mother and child-to-be.

     Today&#39;s lyrics:
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
you&#39;re packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been /
a place that has to believed to be seen &lt;br&gt;
you could have flown away, a singing bird in a open cage /
who will only fly, only fly for freedom &lt;br&gt;
walk on, &lt;a href=&#34;http://u2log.com/2000_10_01_archive.shtml#989250&#34;&gt;walk on&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sometimes things do have to be believed to be seen.

Go, cheer him on, at least if you&#39;re into &lt;a href=&#34;http://geocities.com/r_anderson_au/log.html&#34;&gt;modal epistemology&lt;/a&gt;.  Go, Robert, go!

It&#39;s run by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wpconline.org/&#34;&gt;Western Pennsylvania Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;, and it&#39;s well worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area.

     I&#39;ve just spent the hours since 1:30 in a very difficult meeting.  The atmosphere was poisonous for much of the time.  I must get out and get some fresh air.

     I don&#39;t know what to make of this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They do not see how their otherwise innocent use of the law of the excluded middle too readily becomes a destructive, violent act of political exclusion.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It&#39;s a quote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hope.edu/academic/philosophy/faculty.htm&#34;&gt;Andrew J. Dell&#39;Olio&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s essay: &#34;Between Exclusivity and Plurality&#34;, in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0253213363/&#34;&gt;Postmodern Philosophy and Christian Thought&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, October 10, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1042065&#34;&gt;9:55 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1042065&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/AGOfromSecondCup.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/AGOfromSecondCupSm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[A view of the AGO in Toronto from a coffee shop across the road]&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;326&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Of course, one nice thing about giving talks is meeting lots of nice people.  An enjoyable surprise when I gave my talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/PHIL/cpshelle/philosophy.html&#34;&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago was meeting Brenda, of &lt;a href=&#34;http://freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/&#34;&gt;Isomorphisms&lt;/a&gt; fame.   A bad thing about meeting lots of nice people after having just given a talk is that you feel terribly drained and you cannot think of what to say, as you&#39;ve radically exceeded your politeness quota for saying things anyway after having talked for 50 minutes (well, that&#39;s how it seems to work for me).  So, despite meeting nice people, you feel like a goose and don&#39;t say anything sensible except &#34;hi, nice to meet you.&#34;  More&#39;s the pity.  

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1042028&#34;&gt;9:44 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1042028&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I&#39;m still alive.  I gave a seminar (this time in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;home department&lt;/a&gt; for a change) today.   I normally feel tired after a talk, and when knackered from having a cold, it just takes the rest out of you.  I&#39;ve been completely exhausted all afternoon and evening.
&lt;p&gt;
Counting the number of research talks I&#39;ve given this year, I notice that it comes to 14.  I think I&#39;m glad that I don&#39;t have any scheduled for the rest of the year.


     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Monday, October 09, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1032373&#34;&gt;7:49 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1032373&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I&#39;ve been hearing lots of argle-bargle about the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acer.edu.au/acer/unitest/index.html&#34;&gt;Graduate Skills Testing&lt;/a&gt; proposed by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fed.gov.au/&#34;&gt;Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; and drafted by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acer.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Council for Educational Research&lt;/a&gt;.   The idea is simple: we test people as they leave University on generic skills as an indicator of how &#34;job ready&#34; each graduate is.  There has been one major response by educators:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Why test people all over again with a uniform system-wide university test if it isn&#39;t to rank institutions&#39; performance?  If you want to do this, a &#34;generic skills&#34; test is a very crude measure of how well we are teaching our students.
&lt;/ul&gt;
There&#39;s no doubt that a desire to get a measure of how universities are doing is one factor lying behind this push.  However, as a &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt; educator I have a totally self-interested response which enables me to be a little more sanguine.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acer.edu.au/acer/unitest/gsa/samplequestion.pdf&#34;&gt;sample questions&lt;/a&gt; on their test! It&#39;s exactly the kind of stuff we teach in critical thinking.   Philosophy courses are exactly where we teach you the skills you need for these tests.  Doing intro philosophy is apparently what it takes to be &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/news/regionals/northcoast/monthly/reglis-11sep2000-4.htm&#34;&gt;job ready&lt;/a&gt;&#34;.
&lt;/ul&gt;
It&#39;s nice to know that we&#39;re wanted.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1028528&#34;&gt;9:23 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1028528&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Down with a cold.  Feeling ugh.  Conserving energy.  More later.  Probably much later, after I&#39;ve recovered.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Saturday, October 07, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

You can get everything in vending machines, apparently not just in Japan, but also on the Pennsylvania shores of Lake Erie.  We saw this machine on the way back from Pittsburgh to Toronto.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Friday, October 06, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#1009502&#34;&gt;3:54 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;1009502&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Hi everyone!  I&#39;m back from Toronto and Pittsburgh.  We had lots of fun, and now I&#39;m trying to see how quickly I can get back into Sydney time.  (We arrived at 9am, and I&#39;m in at work cleaning up my desk, browsing the web, and installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/imac/&#34;&gt;desktop computer&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;m also trying to stay awake until evening.)
&lt;p&gt;
It was a blast seeing Sydney at some remove, while away.  Never before have I been able to get an up-to-the-minute idea of how the weather was at home, without getting to a net terminal.  Less impressive was the exchange rate, especially when we were in the U.S.  Ugh!
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, more news later.  Now to go home and relax.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[(These are entries from my blog from 2000 and early 2001. They were originally hosted on a small server at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;Macquarie University&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the links are dead now, but I have kept them as they are here, for nostalgia&amp;rsquo;s sake.)

 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, September 19, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;873896&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Christine and I are heading off to Toronto tomorrow.  This log is going on hiatus for a couple of weeks.  Expect some pictures when I get back.  (Can you tell that I have a digital camera?  We&#39;re only minding it for our trip overseas.  It goes back to its owner when we get back, alas.) 
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#873683&#34;&gt;4:51 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/FencingGerRusLg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/FencingGerRusSm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[The Germans Fencing the Russians]&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I think that I&#39;m not really allowed to post &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/FencingGerRusLg.jpg&#34;&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt;, as I&#39;m not an Olympic broadcaster or journalist.  But, what the heck, I&#39;ll live dangerously.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m back from the Women&#39;s Team Epee quarter- and semi-finals: Russia and Switzerland are off into the Gold medal round tonight, and Hungary play China.  I think the Chinese were the surprise package -- they whipped France, and the French looked rather shocked about it.  Similarly, the Russians beat the Germans, and then rounded it off with a 46-45 win over the Hungarians (who were going in as the favourites).  It was a great way to be introduced to fencing, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/FencingFour.jpg&#34;&gt;four bouts going on at once&lt;/a&gt; at the start, and then two at a time to decide the ranking of those placed 5 to 8, and to decide the Bronze and Gold matches.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.darlingharbour.com.au/&#34;&gt;Darling Harbour&lt;/a&gt; is buzzing, with live music and lots of events.  The transport system is even holding up too, so it looks like the Apocalypse might result in few immediate ill effects.

     &lt;b&gt;Today&#39;s Quote&lt;/b&gt;: &#34;the death of the author does not entail the death of God, since the fact that human authors are not God does not entail that no one else is God nor does it require the death of God as a premise, since human authors could fail to be God even if there is a God.  What the death of the author motif entails (and is entailed by) is not the death of God but the death of Man, where &#34;Man&#34; stands for modernity&#39;s conception of the human self as fully autonomous, both self-positing and self-transparent.&#34;

I wonder if the broadcasts can be heard up there in East Timor?  (Well, I know that you can hear NewsRadio &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/newsradio/listen.htm&#34;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt; on the &#39;net, but I&#39;d be surprised if there many of the population in East Timor have great &#39;net access.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don&#39;t want to spend the rest of my life&lt;br&gt;
Looking at the barrel of an Armalite&lt;br&gt;
I don&#39;t want to spend the rest of my days&lt;br&gt;
Keeping out of trouble like the soldiers say&lt;p&gt;
I don&#39;t want to spend my time in hell&lt;br&gt;
Looking at the walls of a prison cell&lt;br&gt;
I don&#39;t ever want to play the part&lt;br&gt;
Of a statistic on a government chart&lt;p&gt;
There has to be an invisible sun&lt;br&gt;
It gives its heat to everyone&lt;br&gt;
There has to be an invisible sun&lt;br&gt;
That gives us hope when the whole day&#39;s done
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I never knew that was about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stingchronicity.co.uk/stinvisi.html&#34;&gt;the troubles&lt;/a&gt;.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#783668&#34;&gt;8:34 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;783668&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     That&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13069.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sneaky&lt;/a&gt;.   It might be sensible for Amazon to offer discounts to first-time buyers, but do you think it&#39;s sensible to offer discounts for new buyers without letting them, or the regular buyers know about it?  
&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13069.html&#34;&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; the discount only applies to DVDs at present, though there&#39;s no assurance what crazy pricing mechanisms they&#39;ll be able to apply whenever they want.  Think about it: the store is a big computer program.  It&#39;s easy to change prices and to let prices be a function of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; data you&#39;ve got on each individual buyer.  It&#39;s much easier than relabelling stock in an honest-to-goodness &lt;em&gt;shop&lt;/em&gt;.  I think we can expect to see more variable pricing schemes in future as e-businesses attempt to eke out as much revenue as they can on their bare margins.

&lt;p&gt;
Actually, I&#39;d like to think that we could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it happen in the future, but the problem is, it&#39;s really hard to see it in action.  The way Amazon implements the scheme, it&#39;s almost invisible.  I see the prices I see when I browse.  I don&#39;t see the prices &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; see when you browse.  However, it&#39;s not impossible to sidestep the scheme.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13069.html&#34;&gt;There&#39;s a way&lt;/a&gt; to fool Amazon into treating you as a first-time buyer too.    Just trash your cookies and restart your internet connection, or visit Amazon from a machine which hasn&#39;t been used to visit Amazon before.  (Just don&#39;t log in with your old log-in information, or it will recognise you as a previous buyer.)  
&lt;p&gt;
I called this process &#34;fooling&#34; Amazon, but on reflection, I don&#39;t think that doing this this is &lt;em&gt;fooling&lt;/em&gt; them at all.  If they haven&#39;t told us that this is a discount for first-time buyers, then we have no assurance from them that this is not a discount for buyers-from-computers-of-which-they-have-no-records-of-on-their-computers.  (After all, that&#39;s what the software detects.  It doesn&#39;t detect whether or not I&#39;ve bought from them before.) And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; discount is something we can all enjoy.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Dani &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web-therapy.com/2000_09_03_archives.html&#34;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; (and I quote)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Can one who claims that this world began from and in chaos (ie. without any order, purpose or design) apply logic and reason to his/her discussions about it?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The answer is, of course, &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;.  A person who claims that the world has no order, purpose or design can of course reason as logically as anyone else.  They can do whatever everyone else does, I suppose.
&lt;p&gt;
There is a question of whether they can use reasoning 
&lt;em&gt;justifiably&lt;/em&gt;.  Is their commitment to good reasoning, as displayed in their doing it, inconsistent with their commitment to a chaotic unordered world? I suppose
that&#39;s the question Dani is asking.
&lt;p&gt;
Before I go on to answer it, I should complain just gently about the running together of &#34;without order&#34;, &#34;without purpose&#34; and &#34;without design&#34;.  I think these things can all come apart.  Something can have order but no design (raindrops fall in an order, but aren&#39;t designed to -- or at least it seems &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that they aren&#39;t designed) something can have design without purpose (in any ordinary sense of &#34;purpose&#34; -- think of purposeless pieces of art) and many people think that things can have purpose without design (many think that biological systems are like this -- a heart can be &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; pumping blood even if no-one intended it for that).  None of these examples are uncontentious of course, but it begs way too many questions to assume that the three terms stand or fall together.  But, back to the question at hand: can a person who believes that the world is orderless, purposeless and designless still be committed to logical reasoning?
&lt;p&gt;
The answer I prefer for this question is the generous one.  &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; a person who believes that the world has no order, purpose 
or design can reason logically.  Why think that the application of reason only works in an ordered, or purposeful or designed system?  We can reason reasonably about chaos, just as well as order.  Take the person who is &lt;em&gt;agnostic&lt;/em&gt; about the purpose or the design or the order in a situation -- they can still reason about it regardless.  Logic is the story about what follows from what in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; situations.  It&#39;s true of &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; situation (both the designed, ordered and purposeful ones, and those that are not) that
both premises:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greg is a lecturer, 
&lt;li&gt;If Greg is a lecturer, he enjoys his job.
&lt;/ul&gt;
are true, then so is the conclusion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greg enjoys his job.
&lt;/ul&gt;
is true too.  That&#39;s independent of any order, purpose or design, as far as I can tell.  It&#39;s just the inference of &lt;em&gt;modus ponens&lt;/em&gt;, and many people think that it tells us more about how &#34;if ... then ...&#34; works than it does tell us about how the world works. 
&lt;p&gt;
Now, it&#39;s open to you to say that if a situation satisfies &lt;em&gt;modus ponens&lt;/em&gt; and other kinds of logical inferences, then there&#39;s order there and then.  But that&#39;s way too cheap.  If you want to call that &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; then more power too you.  But don&#39;t you dare attempt to infer from this that there&#39;s design or purpose or any of those more robust features.  Had the world been uncreated or had it all been a purposeless cosmic accident then &lt;em&gt;modus ponens&lt;/em&gt; would still work.   That&#39;s &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt;!
&lt;p&gt;
There.  That got that off my chest.  Let none of this lead you to infer anything about my opinions on whether the world as a whole is designed or ordered or created.  I don&#39;t think that a commitment to logic alone is going to get you to that conclusion.  &lt;em&gt;Other&lt;/em&gt; things may well do that.  Of those other things, perhaps more will be said later.
&lt;p&gt;
(This little rant can be seen as an appendix to my earlier &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/misc/faithandlogic.html&#34;&gt;thoughts on logic and faith&lt;/a&gt;.  Perhaps I will merge them one day.  &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;, of course, are always welcome.)

The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.

Now I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A409-2000Sep1.html&#34;&gt;some idea&lt;/a&gt; of what those helicopters were doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2000/2000_08_01_archive/#710161&#34;&gt;that Saturday&lt;/a&gt; buzzing the harbour while we were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2000/2000_08_01_archive/#710161&#34;&gt;making our way home from Manly in a leisurely fashion&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
I don&#39;t know what to make of our Police Commissioner, according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A409-2000Sep1.html&#34;&gt;this quote&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&#34;We expect Sydney to be a very safe city,&#34; said Peter Ryan, the police commissioner for the state of New South Wales, who is in charge of security for the Games. &#34;&lt;em&gt;We have literally planned for every possible contingency&lt;/em&gt;.&#34;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, I don&#39;t know a lot about contingency planning, but I do know that there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more possible scenarios than one can plan for in just a few years.

     I suppose I ought to say something about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0009/hypo.html&#34;&gt;this little Lingua Franca note&lt;/a&gt; about model theory.  I am a model theorist, among other things, so I should say something about the appropriation of my discipline by certain philosophers.  Trouble is: I don&#39;t have a settled opinion about the &#34;model theoretic argument&#34; reported in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0009/hypo.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.

     Life ticks on.  Today, inbetween all of the other stuff, I&#39;m thinking about relationships between proof theories.  In particular, delabelling labelled proof theories.  That probably doesn&#39;t mean much to you.  The problem is, it doesn&#39;t mean too much to me yet either.  I know what I want to do, but I don&#39;t know how to articulate it.  This job fits in nicely with all the other non-intellectual tidying up I need to do.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
TeX has the amazing feature that it can accurately capture the structure of the document, yet render completely consistently on all platforms, allowing great artistic control over layout. The relative popularity of HTML over TeX is of course evidence that the world is unfair.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That post from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.advogato.org/person/raph/&#34;&gt;Raph&lt;/a&gt; has also got some helpful comments on this page about PDF and e-books.

It was &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=procrastination%20%26%20essay&amp;amp;b=100&amp;amp;hc=1&amp;amp;hs=1&#34;&gt;procrastination&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, August 30, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;732552&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I have a sordid confession to make.  I indulge in middle-brow science fiction.  My first love in science fiction is the more creative and wild material, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://world.std.com/~mmcirvin/vitrifax.html&#34;&gt;Stanislaw Lem&lt;/a&gt; and the socialist political novels of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phlebas.com/&#34;&gt;Ian M. Banks&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://sflare.com/fiction/macleod.html&#34;&gt;Ken MacLeod&lt;/a&gt;.  However, occassionally I have been known to descend into the more mainstream material, such as Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s Mars Trilogy.  One author of a similar quality is the Canadian, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfwriter.com/&#34;&gt;Robert J. Sawyer&lt;/a&gt;.  My guilty secret to reveal is that I have spent a couple of hours in a bookshop in the middle of Calgary, reading (and not paying for!) his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfwriter.com/exfh.htm&#34;&gt;Factoring Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.  I had an excuse.  I was wanting a lazy afternoon, I had just explored the museum, and it was pouring with rain.  The bookshop had comfortable seats, and I sat and read an agreeable tale.
&lt;p&gt;
Now I find that he&#39;s written a new book  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfwriter.com/excg.htm&#34;&gt;Calculating God&lt;/a&gt;, with the intruiging premise that aliens come to earth, looking for proof of divine creation.  O for another rainy day in which to waste some more time.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://macweek.zdnet.com/2000/08/27/seybold_gallery/keynote07.html&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a picture of the new graphite mode for Aqua.  No blue.  Just plain greys.

     The &lt;a href=&#34;http://macweek.zdnet.com/2000/08/27/0829sjkeynote.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; piece of good news&lt;/a&gt; about the upcoming MacOS X beta: 
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt; 
The CEO touted a few features that Apple has not previously revealed in its public demonstrations, including one, aimed at graphic artists, that converts the interface colors to &lt;b&gt;graphite&lt;/b&gt; to avoid visual conflicts with artwork.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nice.  Very nice.  I&#39;ll be able to do work without staring at all those &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/finder.html&#34;&gt;candy blue buttons&lt;/a&gt;.

Like I&#39;m slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under&lt;br&gt;
And I feel&lt;br&gt;
Like I&#39;m holding onto nothing
&lt;p&gt;
And these are the days when our work has come assunder&lt;br&gt;
And these are the days when we look for something other&lt;br&gt;

Midnight is where the day begins&lt;br&gt;

The breakouts in these detention centres might just have something to do with the fact that we treat these people badly. It&#39;s a simple matter to do the obvious background security checks first, then release people into the community while the rest of their case is assessed. But no, we lock them up in prison conditions for the whole time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It hasn&#39;t got any better.  Now &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/news/2000/08/item20000828120933_1.htm&#34;&gt;news reports tell us&lt;/a&gt; that there&#39;s serious rioting and the authorities are using water cannon and tear gas on the rioting asylum seekers.  This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the outcome you&#39;d get from a sensible or humane policy.  But then, common sense or humanity is in scarce supply when it comes to our treatment of asylum seekers.

Fresh air, excellent fish and chips, sand and sun at the beach watching a water-skier repeatedly fall attempting spins and turns, a buzz of people with different accents and Sydney tourist guides clutched tightly, way too mutch kitsch at the Saturday markets, and a delightful coffee while waiting for the return ferry.  Winter is going, and it&#39;s being replaced by thousands of people, and a city looking brighter and almost ready for the influx of millions more, both physical and virtual.

     &lt;b&gt;Advice for Olympic Visitors 1&lt;/b&gt;: If you&#39;re swimming at Bondi beach and a siren sounds and you see everyone else swimming in to shore, don&#39;t be worried.  This is just the local custom to vacate the beach, to give untrammelled access for our foreign visitors.  If you happen to see a shark, do not be afraid.  Sydney sharks are friendly creatures, who really appreciate being tickled on the nose.
&lt;p&gt;
(The &lt;a href=&#34;http://local.abc.net.au/sydney/radio/default.htm&#34;&gt;local radio station&lt;/a&gt; has been compiling a list of helpful advice to give our international visitors.)

It&#39;s not the pure, trance inducing music of Reich (hearing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lovely.com/artists/a-double_edge.html&#34;&gt;Double Edge&lt;/a&gt; perform &lt;em&gt;Piano Phase&lt;/em&gt; was a transformative experience for me).   &lt;A href=&#34;http://www.slis.keio.ac.jp/~ohba/Reich/Disc1/srcdremx.html&#34;&gt;Reich Remixed&lt;/A&gt; not even a reinterpretation of Reich.  It&#39;s Reich in a completely different key -- you could call it non-minimal club-style minimalism, based on Reich&#39;s themes.  It goes to show how much you can do with the beautiful tune-fragments Reich has worked with.

It&#39;s not going anywhere, and you&#39;re in need of some help.  You search your computer for references to &lt;em&gt;Carnap&lt;/em&gt; and you discover a draft of a paper you wrote in 1995, with a full four pages of interesting, unpublished and useable material on the topic you&#39;re working on now.  The feeling?  Relief.  And gratitude to your past self.
&lt;p&gt;
The moral of the story.  Don&#39;t trash your drafts.  They come in handy after they&#39;ve had a chance to mature and mellow with age.

It was a buzz, telling prospective students that they ought do philosophy because it was the ultimate transferrable skill.  Philosophy never goes out of date because it doesn&#39;t apply to anything in particular.  (It applies to everything in general.)  Not like those applied computing degrees where everything is outdated in a few years&#39; time.
&lt;p&gt;
They swallowed it, at it looks like we might have a few philosophy students next year.

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/sportsf/stories/s140894.htm&#34;&gt;John Clarke&lt;/a&gt;: Yes, well farnarkling&#39;s a very good example, where I was actually doing a television series on which I did something about sport each week, and that was OK in Australia when we were in the summer, but it got to be a problem when we were in the winter, because there was a different code in a lot of the different places to which the program went. So I decided to standardise it by the invention of a completely different sort of sport, no less bogus than any of the other ones, (have a look at the Colonial Stadium) but full of its own things, it&#39;s own terminology and its own kind of heroes, many unsung, and a hero has to be unsung to a certain extent, sung heroes are you know, Shane Warne and so on, you&#39;re in trouble there. So yes, and I really did enjoy doing it. And I grew up in New Zealand of course, where Rugby is a religious matter, and these people were regarded as being geniuses, people who frankly weren&#39;t geniuses, but were wearing the right clothing. It&#39;s all a bit silly.

     There&#39;s been lots of talk in the media about how silly it is that the Russians aren&#39;t accepting outside help in rescuing their submariners.  The common explanation is that they want to look like they can do it themselves.  I would have thought that the real reason was much more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/08/16/kursk.missile/index.html&#34;&gt;obvious&lt;/a&gt;.

Now for the &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;filing&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
(The especially nice thing is that the text in all those pdf files is automatically indexed by my computer for really neat searching when I&#39;m doing research.  I wish my filing cabinet automagically indexed my photocopies, but alas, that doesn&#39;t happen.)

     I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smith.edu/philosophy/faculty/jgarfield/&#34;&gt;Jay Garfield&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s work.  He&#39;s a great example of someone exploring a particular religious tradition (in his case, Buddhism) and working within interesting areas of analytic philosophy.  His paper &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smith.edu/philosophy/faculty/jgarfield/papers/recently_published/ta_dhd_final.htm&#34;&gt;Temporality and Alterity&lt;/a&gt;&#34; addresses some of these issues.   The quote which leads the article: &#34;If Western philosophers don&#39;t think that philosophy can lead to liberation from cyclic existence, why do they do it?&#34;  Great stuff.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I&#39;ve spent a few hours browsing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/&#34;&gt;ScienceDirect&lt;/a&gt; archive of academic journals.  It&#39;s getting &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; easier to use these net-hosted archives of academic publications: download times are dropping as we get faster net access, and nicer computers mean that the rendering of pdf or postscript files is much more bearable.  However, the user interface still stinks compared with browsing through a library.  There, I can just pick up a journal and flick through the pages.  It will be a while before net-based publications can match this ease of assimilating vast swathes of information quickly.

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hancockd/guests/wayper.htm&#34;&gt;In a shock decision by the International Farnarkling Board, the Dutch Farnarkling team have been disqualified from playing in the 1999 World Series for using a non-regulation Furby during practice. Spies sent from the Dominican Republic revealed that they had obtained the illegal Furby from a Zulu pict during Hogmanay in Abergavenny, and was thus two kilos under weight. This allowed the Dutch team to avoid passing while during knip, as the Furby could safely be bounced along the ground at a rate not equal to the speed of mud.&lt;/a&gt;

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deceptively simple to state, obviously true, but difficult to prove.  Finitely branching trees with finite branches are finite.  Or dually, finitely branching trees which are not finite have some infinite branch.  Just imagine that you&#39;re at the start of a branching series of paths, which divide and divide again, off into the horizon, and a sage tells you: some of these paths have dead-ends, but the whole network is boundless.  How do you go about &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; an infinite path?

     Well, meetings are a strange sort of thing.  I&#39;ve spent all morning in a departmental meeting.  We didn&#39;t actually decide much.  It was one of those meetings where you seem to spend most of the time deciding what it is that you need to decide, and what doesn&#39;t need decisions.  The actual &lt;em&gt;decisions&lt;/em&gt; seem to come later.  At least I seem to have a pretty good grip on what&#39;s happening in my own department, as nothing blindsided me.  (I think it&#39;s taken me a couple of years to actually get to this point.)
&lt;p&gt;

     What a great weekend!  I received some nice super-top-secret news on Saturday which I might tell you all about sometime soon. (It&#39;s nothing to do with work, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;those of you&lt;/a&gt; who know who know the rumours swirling around in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; area of my life.)  Some work done, a great squash hour (we&#39;re getting nice longer rallies now), good meals shared with great people, and even the requisite amount of sleep.    I&#39;m relaxed and in the groove.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, I&#39;m working on a fun teaching project, and even today&#39;s visit to the dentist was relaxing and painless.  
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
arrows with flaming pitch or whatever on them are going to do less good than arrows with little metal bits on the end, which instead of bouncing off people and startling them actually go into them and make them all hurty inside.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There&#39;s much more  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ocs.mq.edu.au/~dnolan/Gladiator.html&#34;&gt;where that came from&lt;/a&gt;.

Lo and behold, overnight I get an email from the author of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.advance.com.ar/usuarios/ferdinandro/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; inviting me to check out his great &lt;em&gt;refutations&lt;/em&gt;.

     &lt;b&gt;Newsflash&lt;/b&gt;: I&#39;m really enjoying teaching.  There&#39;s a crazy buzz involved when you&#39;re addressing a bunch of students.  Of around 450 or so students in a large theatre, and by-and-large, they look and sound like they&#39;re listening and interested, and sometimes, they even laugh at your jokes!  Teaching is a Good Thing.  I didn&#39;t realise how much I&#39;d missed it when I was on study leave.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     A story of a life, or at least, a week: I must think about &lt;a href=&#34;http://software-carpentry.codesourcery.com/Groupware/report.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icaap.org/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I must also, of course, keep up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.mq.edu.au/online/PHIL134/public/index.htm&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and I mustn&#39;t forget &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and helping someone with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  Then, of course, the there are the very important &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; which cannot be named, or at least, linked, at this stage. 
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     The latest policy announcement on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alp.org.au/media/0800/kbmlmsrf020800.html&#34;&gt;research fellowships&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alp.org.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;Good Thing&lt;/em&gt;.  I say that, not just because I suppose I&#39;m in the target market for research fellowships, but also because I care about the higher education system here in Australia.  However, boosting funding for research fellowships is not going to stop the brain drain in and of itself.  What makes overseas so attractive to me, is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/news/2000/2000_07_01_archive/#538622&#34;&gt;general state of the universities here&lt;/a&gt;.  Merely having an elite class of researchers on cozy fellowships is not enough.  How attractive do you think it would be to be a well-funded researcher in a department which is struggling to make ends meet, and attempting to cope with inflated student numbers and staff numbers?  
&lt;p&gt;
Increased funding for research will only pay off in the context of a healthy university environment.  This includes teaching as well as research.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, August 02, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#564649&#34;&gt;3:16 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;564649&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Should I be worried or delighted that a search for &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=Cosmetic%20Surgical%20arts&amp;amp;b=20&amp;amp;hc=1&amp;amp;hs=1&#34;&gt;cosmetic surgical arts&lt;/a&gt; appeared in my referrer logs?
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#563197&#34;&gt;10:13 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;563197&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Let me say something about &lt;em&gt;rights&lt;/em&gt;.  I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to address &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/2000_07_01_archive/#555555&#34;&gt;Russ&#39;&lt;/a&gt; issue of rights to free speech (I think I have nothing clarifying to say about that issue).  What&#39;s exercising me at present is the news that our federal government is going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0008/02/pageone/pageone1.html&#34;&gt;amend the Sex Discrimination Act to prevent its use against state laws which attempt to limit fertility treatment for people outside of heterosexual relationships.&lt;/a&gt;  I don&#39;t want to focus on the subsantive issue at the moment.  What interested me this morning was hearing the rhetoric the Prime Minister used to defend his decision.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/0008/02/pageone/pageone1.html&#34;&gt;He said that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a child&#39;s right to a mother and a father is paramount.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, I can understand him saying that it is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for a child to grow up in a stable home, even a stable two-parent heterosexual relationship home.  Goodness, I can even understand him saying that it&#39;s best for a child to grow up in a family constituted of a husband and a wife who got married in a church and live in a nice two-bedroom house with a picket fence! (I have nothing against church marriages, having had one myself, and I have nothing in particular against picket fences, though I don&#39;t have one of them.)  What I can&#39;t understand is him saying that this is a matter of &lt;em&gt;rights&lt;/em&gt;.  That has to be wrong.

&lt;p&gt;
Why does a child not have a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to grow up in a family with a mother and a father?  It&#39;s simple: a right always brings with it a corresponding obligation or duty.  If I have a right to &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, I have a duty to not take &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; away from you.  If I have a right to free speech, you have a duty to not prevent me from speaking.  If I have a right to food, you have a duty to not take all of the food away from me.  
&lt;p&gt;
Now, how does this work in the case of parenting?  Did my parents have a &lt;em&gt;duty&lt;/em&gt; to not separate, &lt;em&gt;because of me and my brother&lt;/em&gt; when I was a child?  I don&#39;t think so.  I agree that had my parent&#39;s had a functioning relationship it would have been in my interests for them to stay together.  But I don&#39;t see that as a matter of my rights.  If I had rights as a child, they were rights to be cared for and looked after, and my mother did that very very well.  My rights were respected, even though my parents split up.  Let&#39;s take a more stark example.  Does a mother who&#39;s partner dies before childbirth have a &lt;em&gt;duty&lt;/em&gt; to get another partner before the baby is born?  Surely she should if the baby has a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to two parents.  No, it&#39;s sad that the baby will not be raised by both parents, but no-one would want to say that she &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; find another partner to father the baby.
&lt;p&gt;
No, this rights talk is all a furphy.  I agree: Children have a right to be cared for.  I don&#39;t see how this means that they have a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to two parents.
&lt;p&gt;
Why does the Government talk of rights in this context?  It&#39;s simple.  If the P.M. simply said &#34;we think it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for children to have two parents&#34; and directed its legislation accordingly, then the government would be seen as engaging in the kind of social engineering they take belong to the other side of politics.  And we can&#39;t have that.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;I know that the way I&#39;ve put this is contentious.  Do you agree with me?  Or disagree?  If you&#39;ve got somthing 
to say, post it at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenspun.com/com/_classify_input/grestall/log/&#34;&gt;Comments page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

     Similarity Strangeness at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.  What do you make of this? According to the search engine, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kottke.org/&#34;&gt;kottke.org&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://related.google.com/search?q=related%3Awww.prolific.org&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;safe=off&#34;&gt;similar to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prolific.org/&#34;&gt;prolific.org&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prolific.org/&#34;&gt;prolific.org&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://related.google.com/search?q=related%3Awww.kottke.org&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;safe=off&#34;&gt;similar to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prolific.org/&#34;&gt;kottke.org&lt;/a&gt;.  I would have thought that if &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is similar to &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; is similar to &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, but I&#39;m prepared to stand corrected.
(I can think of a couple of reasons why this result might surface.  I wonder what the real reason is.)
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;This meditation on search engines is brought to you by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/miniwetlog/2000_08_01_archive/#1.8.00&#34;&gt;Neale&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; revelation that he is &lt;a href=&#34;http://related.google.com/search?q=related%3Awww.wrongwaygoback.com&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;safe=off&#34;&gt;rather special&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

     Phil&#39;s email reminded me too of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing&#34;&gt;Background Briefing&lt;/a&gt; program on University quality in Australia.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/s153481.htm&#34;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of that saddening program is now available.  There&#39;s some provocative stuff in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://highered.theoz.com.au/&#34;&gt;Higher Ed&lt;/a&gt; site at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theoz.com.au/&#34;&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s a pity that the terrible design of the site makes it well-nigh impossible to link to. 
&lt;p&gt;
Higher education policy will probably play at least a small part in the upcoming federal election.  It ought to, as the higher education sector is in terrible crisis, with pay rises being awarded, unfunded from the &lt;a href=&#34;www.detya.gov.au&#34;&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;.  Salaries have gone up roughly 12% in the last 5 years or so, while funding to the universities has remained static.  Student numbers have gone through the roof, but staff numbers have shrunk.  Hence, class sizes rise, staff-student ratios drop, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nteu.org.au/debates/workload00.html&#34;&gt;everyone&#39;s unhappy&lt;/a&gt;.  A structural crunch is coming.

     Well, as of this afternoon, the &lt;a href=&#34;#527029&#34;&gt;numbers&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;b&gt;502&lt;/b&gt;, so the traditional &#34;after the first lecture where people get to see what&#39;s in store&#34; drop-off hasn&#39;t happened yet.  
&lt;p&gt;
The lecture last night was a blast for me.  It was good to get back into the saddle and attempt to entertain and educate a large group.  Apparently, at least a few enjoyed themselves: I got this email from a student:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Great lecture Greg.........considering I only have  to come
in for the PHIL lecture on a Thursday...I figured I&#39;d just
stay at home...but your acerbic wit will no doubt be
tempting enough for me to get into my 20 year old Sigma and drive to uni...heh heh heh keep it up.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Talk about pressure.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;533775&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/~wgrey/morsoc/&#34;&gt;Ian Hinckfuss: The Moral Society -- Its Structure and Effects&lt;/a&gt;, is now online.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/~hinck/hinck.html&#34;&gt;Hinck&lt;/a&gt; taught me moral philosophy, logic, metaphysics, and many other things besides, while I was a Ph.D. student at the University of Queensland.  He was one of the kindest, gentlest and warmest human beings I&#39;ve had the pleasure to know, and his death was a devastating loss to all of us who were in his orbit.  I can still remember his infectious laugh, his outrage at injustice (though, of course, he wouldn&#39;t put it that way!) and his sharp intellect.  I can only hope that I have half the effect on others that he has had on me, and on the rest of the Australian philosophical community.
&lt;p&gt;
So, in his memory, read his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/~wgrey/morsoc/&#34;&gt;passionate, reasoned and sustained defence of amoralism&lt;/a&gt;.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     So &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2607921,00.html&#34;&gt;that&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; what the handwriting recognition guys from the Newton project have been doing with their free time.  As far as I can tell, handwriting recognition only catches on with devices in which a keyboard is unavailable.  I can&#39;t see this catching on as a useful input method for desktop or laptop devices where a keyboard is right there.  Now, for a &lt;em&gt;slate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tablet&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;palmtop&lt;/em&gt; it would make sense.  Let&#39;s see what they have in store for us.  (It was touching to see the font &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/graphics/library/0007/0007ink/ink2.html&#34;&gt;Casual&lt;/a&gt;, and the little caret insertion point back in action too.)

     Here&#39;s more thoughtful analysis from &lt;a href=&#34;http://joel.editthispage.com/&#34;&gt;Joel on Software&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$139&#34;&gt;Does Issuing Passports Make Microsoft a Country?&lt;/a&gt;  I&#39;m not a Microsoft Passport user, and I&#39;m mighty glad that I&#39;m not, after reading this article.  You should read this article too, if you browse the web.  It&#39;s got a very good explanation of how cookies work.
&lt;p&gt;
One thing I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; about how Mac OS 9 works is the &lt;em&gt;keychain&lt;/em&gt;.  I keep a local copy of all of my account passwords on my computer, protected with a master password.  I can allow my network programs access to the keychain, and I need to know one password to unlock the master keychain.  This is great for my personal accounts on other machines, and to get into ftp directories (such as on this university webserver at Macqurie.)  However, the &lt;em&gt;web browsers&lt;/em&gt; don&#39;t use Keychain, so I still need to remember my passwords for all of these web services, like Blogger, Amazon, my &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/PHIL134&#34;&gt;web courseware&lt;/a&gt; and so on.  (Better yet will be when I can access my local machine anywhere on the network, so I don&#39;t have to keep two local copies on my two regularly-used machines.)  So we&#39;re not there yet.  Still, this technique of password management seems much better than the kind of centralised repository in the clutches of an organisation who can sell my data.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Dinner last night with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/phil/faculty/normore.html&#34;&gt;Calvin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/philosophy/staff.htm#brown&#34;&gt;Debbie&lt;/a&gt;, George (their son), their friends David and Christine, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/philosophy/staff.htm#tanaka&#34;&gt;Koji&lt;/a&gt; was fantastic.  The restaurant was described as a &#34;cheap and cheerful&#34; Italian place.  Well, it wasn&#39;t too expensive (especially for Bondi), it certainly was cheerful, but the description cannot do justice to the astonishingly good lemon sole.  The best fish I&#39;ve eaten in years.
&lt;p&gt;
Less delightful was the sight of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.voyeurmagic.com.au/olympic1.htm&#34;&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cat.org.au/lists/sydney/msg00432.html&#34;&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/info/olympic/usyd&#34;&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which takes up altogether too much of the beach.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lord of the starfields / Ancient of Days
/ Universe Maker / here&#39;s a song in your praise.
&lt;p&gt;
Wings of the storm cloud / beginning and end /
you make my heart leap / like a banner in the wind.
&lt;p&gt;
O Love that fires the sun / keep me burning.
&lt;p&gt;
Lord of the starfields / sower of life, / heaven and earth are / full of your light.
&lt;p&gt;
Voice of the nova / smile of the dew / all of our yearning / only comes home to you.
&lt;p&gt; 
O Love that fires the sun / keep me burning.

Worship and the erotic are never far apart, of course, and Bruce&#39;s song &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stealing-fire.com/bcll/LyricsFromFilename.asp?LyricFile=mangoinhergarden.hti&#34;&gt;Mango&lt;/a&gt; is his best recent example of the art.

     I&#39;m back in the groove at work.  Lots of students, lots of energy.  I&#39;ve even got time to do just a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; research for a project that&#39;s been at the back of my head for a few years.  (If anyone has any experience in anaphora, epsilon terms and modal or intensional logic, please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s esoteric, but that&#39;s one of the costs of being a logician.)
&lt;p&gt;
These are exciting times.  As a result, posts here will be thinner on the ground than before I got back to teaching.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Monday, July 24, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#517031&#34;&gt;5:49 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;517031&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Someone make it stop.  I&#39;ve got &lt;b&gt;464&lt;/b&gt; students now.  Where are they coming from?
&lt;p&gt;
Seriously, this is both a good and a bad thing.  I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; that I have lots of students wanting to learn logic.  That&#39;s nice.  I think every university student ought to do some logic.  However, large classes (mine will stabilise down to around 400, I think) are difficult to teach.  Yes, there&#39;s the delight of the &lt;em&gt;theatricality&lt;/em&gt; of having 400 students laughing at your jokes, and obviously wanting to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;. (No, I don&#39;t have a starry-eyed view of the university students of our era.  I am exceedingly lucky, however, to have students who do my subjects because they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to.  Intro Logic is not a required unit for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; degree in this university.  People are doing this unit because it&#39;s fun, and because they&#39;ve heard about it from friends.)
&lt;p&gt;
All that is one thing, however.  Teaching 400 has its pains and trials.  It&#39;s hard to give the 20% of students who really need hands-on attention the attention they deserve.  It&#39;s hard to give the 20% who thrive on being stretched to do new things the attention they deserve.  Attention can only spread so far.
&lt;p&gt;
Still, this large enrolment pays for my job.  I should be grateful.  I am.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I&#39;m a busy boy today.  It&#39;s the first week of Semester 2, and I have lots of class preparation to do.  A cursory check of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/ug/134/&#34;&gt;134&lt;/a&gt; enrolments  for this year shows that they are at a staggering &lt;b&gt;429&lt;/b&gt;.  Hmm.  Must get more books printed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&#34;My advice to students is to be born in 1943, and get your Ph.D. by 1968,&#34; Perry told his listeners. &#34;Because everybody got nice offers in 1968, but by 1969 the bottom dropped out of the job market and it&#39;s been out ever since.&#34; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Too true.

&lt;span class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;How many cabs in New York City, how many angels on a pin?&lt;br&gt;
How many notes in a saxophone, how many tears in a bottle of gin?&lt;br&gt;
How many times did you call my name, knock at the door but you couldn&#39;t get in?&lt;br&gt;
I know I&#39;ve been careless&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve been wrapped up in a shell nothing could get through to me&lt;br&gt;
Acted like I didn&#39;t know I had friends or family&lt;br&gt;
I saw worry in their eyes, it didn&#39;t look like fear to me&lt;br&gt;
I know I&#39;ve been careless (I took bad care of this)&lt;/span&gt;

     Just one link in the break between administrative meetings:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_843000/843163.stm&#34;&gt;Tau Neutrino Detected&lt;/a&gt;.  This is great news.  It&#39;s confirmation of the symmetry in the standard model, or so the physicists suppose.  (Go read some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198248601/&#34;&gt;Bas van Fraassen&lt;/a&gt; on why you&#39;d expect scientific laws to expose such symmetries.)

It&#39;s time to crank up the teaching preparation for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/timetable.html&#34;&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt; and I have tutors&#39; meetings and other administration to look after today.  To keep your brain ticking over, do take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.attrition.org/gallery/other/bizare.gif&#34;&gt;this puzzle&lt;/a&gt;.  (Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/&#34;&gt;isomorphisms&lt;/a&gt; for the pointer.  She&#39;s right.  It&#39;s a lot simpler to see and describe the phenomenon when the triangles are placed on a grid.)  
&lt;p&gt;
Now I&#39;m off the computer, enjoying a coffee, Erasmus&#39; company, and an hour of thesis marking before I catch my lift to work.

     I paid a visit to the dentist this morning.  It brought back bad memories of my early teens, with four extractions (badly done) and painful braces getting my teeth in order. My family weren&#39;t well off, and I went to the government funded dental hospital in Brisbane.  The dentists there seemed extraordinarily brutal, and I have avoided dentists ever since.  Well, the visit to the dentist today was good.  I needed major work on a tooth, which did involve some pain, but nothing like my traumatic memories of past dental encounters.  This time, good sense, yoga practice (breathing is your friend!), curiosity about the kind of pain you feel when &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; nerve is stimulated, and knowledge that I was not going to die from it, all added up into a much less difficult experience.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#39;s an amazing history.

     And people thought the original macintosh looked like a toaster.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powermaccube/&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a toaster.  Complete with DVD or CD-ROM popping out vertically, like the toasters you know and love.
&lt;p&gt;
Matched with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/displays/asd15/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, it would save lots of room on my desk, even compared with the iMac which is currently there.

     Just got out of a 2.5 hour meeting, the highlight of which is news that the apocalypse will be held in 2002.   This is the first year we will turn our undergraduate timetabling over to a massive &lt;a href=&#34;http://arp.anu.edu.au/~jks/finder.html&#34;&gt;constraint satisfaction problem solver&lt;/a&gt;.   I look forward to the outcry from staff and students to the timetabling of their lectures at 5pm on Friday.    That&#39;s of course conditional upon the changes actually occurring.  Given the minimal predictive value of any institutional statement of the form &#34;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; will happen in a year&#39;s time&#34; I have no doubt that it &lt;em&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; happen as stated.  It will, no doubt, be much worse.

     Hmmm.  Microsoft wants our software to do &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/biztech/articles/17lab.html&#34;&gt;Bayesian reasoning&lt;/a&gt; to schedule our meetings and to know when it&#39;s worthwhile to interrupt me? Now, I get a moderate amount of email (upward of 50 messages a day?) but I prefer being in control of this myself.  Simple rule based filters are a good thing.  A computer running a hacked up calculus on its messages is going to be a &lt;em&gt;Bad Thing&lt;/em&gt; if it means I have to do lots of work to figure out where that important message went, or why I have a meeting scheduled for 10am tomorrow.  No, I have to learn to &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; complex agents, and I don&#39;t think software agents will garner that trust for quite some time.
&lt;p&gt;
(Well there&#39;s one bright part of this story: It&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com/~horvitz/&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Research&lt;/a&gt; doing this, not Microsoft &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt;, so it&#39;s not going to be implemented Any Time Soon.)

     Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;philosophy department&lt;/a&gt; should seek sponsorship by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.routledge.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Routledge&lt;/a&gt;, the academic publisher.  Look at the books we&#39;ve written for them!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0415036011/&#34;&gt;Morality and Modernity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Ross Poole, 1991

&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/041521534X/&#34;&gt;An Introduction to Substructural Logics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by me, 2000.
&lt;/ul&gt;
Of course, we don&#39;t ignore other publishers.   John Sutton has published &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521591945/&#34;&gt;Philosophy and Memory Traces&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://uk.cambridge.org/&#34;&gt;CUP&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, and Catriona Mackenzie has published &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195123336/&#34;&gt;Relational Autonomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oup.co.uk/&#34;&gt;OUP&lt;/a&gt; in 1999.  
&lt;p&gt;
That&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of publishing.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Oh dear.  More &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feedmag.com/essay/es359lofi.html&#34;&gt;confusion&lt;/a&gt; about the nature of time.  Julian Barbour&#39;s stuff is interesting, when it comes to showing that our uninformed conception of time and its passing is confused and in conflict with the findings of modern science.  But to say that as a result, time doesn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;?  I suppose it gets you more headlines than saying &#34;not everything we thought about time is correct.&#34;  This kind of na&amp;iuml;ve popularisation gives theoretical physics a bad name.

It will be a happy/sad occassion.  We&#39;ll miss Ross terribly as a department (who will throw the good parties in the department now?), and I&#39;ll miss him as an individual (he has excellent knowledge of our institution, and how to be a decent  human being inside an institution like a modern university).  He&#39;s taught me more than he realises, and I&#39;ll miss him more than I know.  Still, our loss is New York&#39;s gain, and now, I&#39;ll have another port of call in another Big City.

Not that I have anything to say about the matter at all.
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, having used the phrase &#34;crimes committed in the casino at australia&#34; &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; on the one page makes it even more likely that people searching for that topic will find me.  Oh well.

I had selected them with one-click ordering, then the shop closed for an hour, and after I got back on I tried to cancel my order.   They couldn&#39;t be cancelled.  I sent off an irate email, and I got a suprisingly nice reply.  Yes, they agreed, they&#39;d stuffed up.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000025ZP8/&#34;&gt;One CD&lt;/a&gt; was already on its way, but they&#39;d try to stop the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000001176/&#34;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; before it left US shores.  For the CD on its way, they&#39;d airmail a return pack to me, and ask me to return the CD when I got it, then they&#39;d credit my card.  (Which, needless to say, had already been debited for both CDs.) Now, knowing my own capacity for self-control, I knew I wouldn&#39;t resist when faced with a small cardboard box between me and a Keith Jarrett CD which was, legally, mine.  So, I wasn&#39;t happy with this solution.  No, I said: my main problem was the shipping charges.  Why not charge me for only one shipment?  (That gets the total charge just a tad under the AUS$30 per CD we pay in shops.)  I then get both CDs without having to ship one back and then order it &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, hoping that they don&#39;t stuff it up a second time.  It suprised me when they said &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt; that would do nicely, and they cancelled &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; shipping charges.  I&#39;m enjoying the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000001176/&#34;&gt;T-Bone Burnett&lt;/a&gt; now.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000025ZP8/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.consequently.org/images/keithjarrettparis.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;[Keith Jarrett Paris Concert]&#34; width=&#34;130&#34; height=&#34;130&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The moral of the story seems to be this: it was obvious that I was dealing with a human being throughout the email discussion.  It was the same person who read and replied to both my emails, and she was flexible enough, and empowered enough, to evaluate and act on my requests.  In doing this, Amazon at least begins to &lt;em&gt;approximate&lt;/em&gt; a real live store with real live people I can have real live conversations with.  
&lt;p&gt;
Imagine what would happen if you were browsing in a physical shop, with a few selections in a basket, and the shop suddenly announced that it was closed and they were immediately charging you for what you had on hand?  What possible responses could you make?  To whom?  If you know you&#39;re dealing with a person who has some degree of understanding of the situation, then you&#39;re much more likely to get a reasonable outcome.  If you deal with the corporation as a whole, you never know that your whole story has been listened to.  Your pleas get sucked into a void, and it&#39;s not clear that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; has the whole picture.  I know which kind of corporation I prefer dealing with.
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, I have no assurance that the economic conditions encourage this kind of personal attention from individuals inside corporations.  I do know that the dynamic of increased staff-student ratios inside universities make it increasingly harder for me to treat my students individually.  I don&#39;t see that this pressure is going to abate in either my academic environment, or the corporate world.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mitchell has more to do to make his line on hooliganism at all convincing or even defensible.    He should be flattered that he&#39;s got the attention.  Now he&#39;d better do something creative with it.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Monday, July 10, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;447934&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Well there you go: &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_825000/825641.stm&#34;&gt;Ridley Scott thinks that Deckard is a replicant&lt;/a&gt;.  Now the BBC are reporting this as meaning that Deckard &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a replicant, but I don&#39;t see that this follows.  
&lt;p&gt;
A director can say whatever he/she likes about significance of a film.  It doesn&#39;t follow that this is what the film &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt;.  If Scott makes the film ambiguous, so that it can be legitimately interpreted in a couple of ways (as Blade Runner manifestly can), then not even his own say-so renders one of those interpretations as the only appropriate one.  If he wanted us to take Deckard to be a replicant, he should have made the &lt;em&gt;film&lt;/em&gt; say so.  I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the fact that the film is ambiguous.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;[Disclaimer: I note that I might be taken to be a relativist there&#39;s-no-absolute-truth philosopher here because I&#39;m denying the primacy of authorial intent in interpretation.  But that would also be inappropriate to deduce.  I&#39;m saying this out of respect for what the film says (and for what it doesn&#39;t say), not because I think that everything can be legitimately interpreted in every-which-way.]
&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

Don&#39;t the hours grow shorter as the days go by&lt;br /&gt;
you never get to stop and open your eyes&lt;br /&gt;
one day you&#39;re waiting for the sky to fall&lt;br /&gt;
the next you&#39;re dazzled by the beauty of it all&lt;br /&gt;
when you&#39;re lovers in a dangerous time&lt;br /&gt;
lovers in a dangerous time
&lt;p&gt;
These fragile bodies of touch and taste&lt;br /&gt;
this vibrant skin -- this hair like lace&lt;br /&gt;
spirits open to the thrust of grace&lt;br /&gt;
never a breath you can afford to waste&lt;br /&gt;
when you&#39;re lovers in a dangerous time&lt;br /&gt;
lovers in a dangerous time
&lt;p&gt;
When you&#39;re lovers in a dangerous time&lt;br /&gt;
sometimes you&#39;re made to feel as if your love&#39;s a crime --&lt;br /&gt;
but nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight --
&lt;br /&gt;got to kick at the darkness &#39;til it bleeds daylight&lt;br /&gt;
when you&#39;re lovers in a dangerous time&lt;br /&gt;
lovers in a dangerous time&lt;br /&gt;
and we&#39;re lovers in a dangerous time&lt;br /&gt;
lovers in a dangerous time

The first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usc.edu.au/News/conf/aal/index.html&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; was great, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uq.edu.au/~pddhyde/aap2000.html&#34;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; is going well too.  I always relax after giving my own talk, and given that this was scheduled on Monday morning, the rest of my time should be relaxing and enjoyable.  (Except for missing Christine, who I just took to the airport so she could fly back to Sydney.)

     Just about to get on the train to the airport, and I want to check my bank details on the web.  Oddly, the domain name servers are screwy today.  I can access some websites at without their &#34;www&#34; prefixes (such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://weblogs.com/&#34;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;) but not with them (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weblogs.com/&#34;&gt;www.weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;).  I can get to my bank website OK, but through a nonstandard domain name, and this means that the security certificate isn&#39;t accepted by my browser, and the connection isn&#39;t secure.   Does anyone know what DNS problems could cause this?
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you want to get some sequencing done for &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt;, you don&#39;t need to get all the tricky equipment.  Instead, you can  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agrf.org.au/pricing.html&#34;&gt;employ the experts&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s nice to know that you can get my sequencing, genotyping and genetic diagnostics done so affordably.

     Christine and I are off to Brisbane and Noosa for conferences until July 8.  We fly out tomorrow midday, and I have heaps of things to do between now and then.  (Like watching Episode 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/architecture&#34;&gt;The Mind of the Architect&lt;/a&gt;.)  Expect updates here to be rather infrequent.

     It is a strange thing being an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/&#34;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only do you get stupid feelings in a bookshop (if your book is not there, it is evidence it is not popular because the bookshop is not stocking it; if it is there, it is evidence that it is not selling), your ever helpful readers who send you  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/errata.html&#34;&gt;corrections&lt;/a&gt; leave you in quite some doubt if anyone has actually made it past the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/errata.html&#34;&gt;first half of the book&lt;/a&gt;.  Someone should warn prospective authors of the highs and lows of the publishing game.

     A disruption is a nice way to start the day.  We had booked for some floor sanders and polishers to come and (what do you expect?) sand and polish our floors.  Our hallway, to be precise.  The booking was, I had thought, for Monday and Tuesday, with a possible extension to Wednesday to accomodate drying time.  Just in time for us to jet up to Noosa for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usc.edu.au/News/conf/aal/index.html&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;.  It turns out that they had taken the booking to involve starting on Monday &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; Tuesday.  Given that apparently &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; in Sydney is getting their floors polished this week before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://taxreform.ato.gov.au/&#34;&gt;apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, &#34;Monday or Tuesday&#34; means &#34;Tuesday&#34; or possibly &#34;Wednesday.&#34; Well, this screws all our plans up mightily.  &lt;em&gt;Excellent&lt;/em&gt;.

     Excuse me a minute for a little theological &amp;amp; personal reflection
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
We may trust God with our past as heartily as with our future.  It will not hurt us so long as we do not try to hide things, so long as we are ready to bow our heads in hearty shame where it is fit we should be ashamed.  For to be ashamed is a holy and blessed thing.  Shame is a thing to shame only those who want to &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt;, not to those who want to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;.  Shame is shame to those who want to pass their examination, not those who would get into the heart of things . . . To be humbly ashamed is to be plunged into the cleansing bath of truth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That&#39;s from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.george-macdonald.com/&#34;&gt;George MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s something really unpopular with the idea of shame, but when you think about it, being shame&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; is a sad thing.  Our actions have weight, and sometimes we do things which we regret.  If so, shame is proper.  Of course, people are often ashamed of completely the wrong things altogether, and that&#39;s sad too.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &#34;Before the Americans could Americanize the rest of the world, they had to Americanize themselves.&#34;  An insightful comment by Alan Saunders, in his commentary on Ang Lee&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ride-with-the-devil.com/&#34;&gt;Ride with the Devil&lt;/a&gt;.  I never thought of the U.S. Civil War as the march of capitalism and modernity, but thinking of it, it makes sense.  Hmm. Might go to see that movie, if I have time.

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.une.edu.au/~arts/Philosop/pforrest.htm&#34;&gt;Peter Forrest&lt;/a&gt; writes touchingly about how he sees doing philosophy.  I&#39;ve seen his house in Uralla, and it&#39;s so big, I really wonder which renovation project will finish first: his rehabilitation of Christianity, or his restoration of the house.  My bet is not with the house.
&lt;p&gt;
For a completely different (but no less fascinating) take on philosophy, try his colleague &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.une.edu.au/~arts/Philosop/dagostino.htm&#34;&gt;Fred D&#39;Agostino&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s explanation of why he likes philosophy.  And Elvis.

It&#39;s a good thing that they realise that the way they treat each other is inhuman, given that they helped drive one of their colleagues to despair and to suicide.  (Greg Wilton&#39;s tragic death was provoked also by a personal relationship breakup.  There&#39;s no doubt that the ugliness of parliament was not the only factor, nor perhaps the dominant one.)  Still, the orgy of tears and regret in Parliament a couple of days ago was striking.  Yet you would have to be naive to think that this signalled any real or lasting change.  At most, it was a sign that people were coming to realise what pressures they are under, and the costs of working in the way they do.  Nothing has changed to make these pressures any less, or to take away the motivations for personal abuse and petty mindedness in parliament.  Good intentions won&#39;t cut it. 
&lt;p&gt;
 Little did I suspect that this would be made abundantly clear &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/news/2000/06/item20000622024321_1.htm&#34;&gt;so soon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I especially liked the way that the constitution was etched into the windows.  (Don&#39;t know what happens when we amend the constitution?  Replace the windows?)  I would love to work in a place where such care was taken to the built environment.  Alas, my building at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Macquarie&lt;/a&gt; is not such a place.

Peter Hollo&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourplay.com.au/blog/&#34;&gt;[Stumblings in the dark]&lt;/a&gt; are amusing reading, though.

     Now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguafranca.com/0005/field-thanks.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one way to round out a thesis.

     From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.georgemag.com/&#34;&gt;George Magazine&lt;/a&gt; (not a regular read, I&#39;m afraid, but a link followed from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cybereditions.com/aldaily/&#34;&gt;Arts &amp;amp; Letters Daily&lt;/a&gt;) an article on cosmetic surgery.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.georgemag.com/xp6/George/Features/beauty.xml&#34;&gt;They are undergoing operations like liposuction, currently the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure in America but unfortunately more likely to kill you than a traffic accident.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Does this mean that given a random American (I&#39;m assuming that the sample is American) they&#39;re more likely to die of liposuction than in a traffic accident, or does it mean that given that I&#39;m out in traffic, the likelihood that I&#39;ll die that way is lower than the probability that I die of liposuction, given that I go into the surgery?  The first option is truly bad, the second is not so surprising at all.  (It&#39;s surgery, after all, and there&#39;s always a risk when you go under then knife.)  Alas, the article isn&#39;t so clear. 

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This comes from David Gelernter&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gelernter/gelernter_p1.html&#34;&gt;Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; on the future of computing.  This has been doing the rounds on the net for the last couple of days, and I have caved in an posted a link here too, as I finally got around to reading it.  
&lt;p&gt;
Gelernter&#39;s obviously right when he proclaims the importance of metaphor, and he&#39;s right when he says that the file/folder metaphor employed in current user interfaces is unhelpful.  Why must files have one and only one name?  Why must I files be placed in one and only one directory? 
&lt;p&gt;
(This is yet &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_04_01_archive.html#129692&#34;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; reason why the Newton was, and is, so revolutionary.   No files.  &#34;Direct&#34; manipulation of the storage.  No need to choose names for notes or folders to put things in.)  
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, software has a lot of work to do to catch up with hardware.

     &lt;a name=&#34;357926&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Just a little rant before I get back into work.  
&lt;p&gt;
This is provoked by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/&#34;&gt;wetlog&#39;s pointer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_792000/792477.stm&#34;&gt;BBC article&lt;/a&gt; about our government&#39;s appalling &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00063.htm&#34;&gt;propoganda&lt;/a&gt; campaign against asylum seekers.   What&#39;s the deal here? Since when have asylum seekers been &lt;em&gt;queue jumpers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;illegal immigrants&lt;/em&gt;?  Since when have we the right to lock them up in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00062.htm&#34;&gt;detention centres&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://asri.cossa.csiro.au/Library/ImageLibrary/Woomera/&#34;&gt;middle of nowhere&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00062.htm&#34;&gt;breakouts&lt;/a&gt; in these detention centres might just have something to do with the fact that we treat these people badly.  It&#39;s a simple matter to do the obvious background security checks first, then release people into the community while the rest of their case is assessed.  But no, we lock them up in prison conditions for the whole time.  And we treat them as illegal immigrants, when there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unhcr.ch/refworld/refworld/legal/instrume/asylum/1951eng.htm&#34;&gt;international conventions&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to treat refugees.  We&#39;re not exactly up to &lt;em&gt;best practice&lt;/em&gt; here.  (This is one consequence of living in a country which is still ambivalent about immigrants in general.  It probably has something to do with the fact that most of us are immigrant stock ourselves: we know how easy it was to displace the original people of this land, and we are rather frightened that it might happen to us.)
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, buried in one &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00062.htm&#34;&gt;ministerial press release&lt;/a&gt; I find the damning number.  We&#39;ve only seen &lt;em&gt;4000&lt;/em&gt; &#34;illegal entries&#34; in the last year!  (The UNHCR &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unhcr.ch/world/asia/australi.htm&#34;&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt; for Australia say we&#39;re housing about 61,000&lt;/a&gt; refugees in total at present.)  And this government complains about the &lt;em&gt;flood&lt;/em&gt; of illegals?  Let&#39;s try housing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unhcr.ch/world/afri/sudan.htm&#34;&gt;392,000&lt;/a&gt; housed by Sudan in 1998?  I will be watching with interest to see the UNHCR &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unhcr.ch/world/asia/australi.htm&#34;&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; of Australia&#39;s performance in 2000.  Our mediocre performance before 2000 has given us good standing in the global community.  I cannot imagine that this current turn of rhetoric, and behaviour, bodes well for the future.

     Well, I&#39;ve joined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mikel.org/&#34;&gt;crowd&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saturn.org/&#34;&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; who&#39;ve implemented searching.  I decided I&#39;d like it not so that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can search, but so that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can find my past comments quickly.  But, my gain is your gain, so search away.  &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt; if something doesn&#39;t work.
&lt;p&gt;
Note: The index is updated weekly.  Try the search box only after scanning this page with your browser&#39;s &#34;Find&#34; command.  That way you&#39;ll get everything, as this page contains the last couple of week&#39;s entries.

     Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~lnewton/music/JarrettSketch.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; little biography of Keith Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ve listened to the K&amp;amp;ouml;ln concert through a few times, and it strikes me as the most &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; jazz performance I&#39;ve heard.  Thinking about it, it&#39;s the only solo jazz performance I&#39;ve heard, and this probably has something to do with it.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epinions.com/musc-review-719F-3FD3753-38D51437-prod5&#34;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.checkout.com/music/artist/bio/0,7644,409001,00.html&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; find Jarrett&#39;s &#39;sing-along&#39; tendencies &lt;em&gt;distracting&lt;/em&gt;, but for me, they just add to the directness of the performance.  I can tell that this is not just a piano playing.  He is a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; playing a piano.  And playing it &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Functional programming is a way to while away the evening.  Three free functional programming environments for you to play with: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/Hugs/pages/latest.htm&#34;&gt;Hugs (Haskell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://pauillac.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html&#34;&gt;Objective Caml&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.kun.nl/~clean/&#34;&gt;Concurrent Clean&lt;/a&gt;.  Each work on my Macintosh, and each are really slick ways to hack up simple logic-related programs.

I&#39;ve spent a few minutes trying to dig up some transcripts of John Clarke&#39;s &lt;em&gt;farnarkling&lt;/em&gt; commentaries from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ozcomedy.com/journal/11imcf.htm&#34; title=&#34;This is an article about Australian Comedy.  The references to the Gillies Report are in there.&#34;&gt;Gillies Report&lt;/a&gt;.  No such luck.
&lt;p&gt;
John Clarke&#39;s lasting influence can be found in the various &lt;a href=&#34;http://management.canberra.edu.au/lectures/law/sem981/unit0765/assignment.html&#34;&gt;farnarkling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hyperstudy.com/jobzone/writingyourresume.html&#34;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~winikoff/aivcf/rest.htm&#34;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.edfac.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/TEST_1/other/W1c_refw1.html&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
What a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; day I&#39;ve had browsing today!  I&#39;ve found things for both my own personal enrichment, for my research, and for the benefit of my students.&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(I&#39;m realising more and more that there&#39;s beauty in many different places, if you&#39;re prepared to keep your eyes and ears open.)

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     Why did no-one tell me about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/recordings/1064.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; before now?   Oooh.  It&#39;s positively beautiful.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve been a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/artists/47.html&#34;&gt;Keith Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; fan for some time, but I&#39;ve never before reached back this far in his career.   It brings you to tears to know what one person + one piano is capable of producing.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     Did you know that the anthropic principle has its own site &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anthropic-principle.com/&#34;&gt;www.anthropic-principle.com&lt;/a&gt;?  
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I should register &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.begging-the-question.com/&#34;&gt;www.begging-the-question.com&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
(Actually, a lot of the site is about the doomsday argument and not the anthropic principle, and they are not the same thing.  However, they&#39;re important philosophical arguments and reflecting on them leads one to a better understanding of what we might be able to know and why.  I think they do &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than they&#39;re commonly taken to achieve.  However, to go into that, I&#39;ll need to spend some time collecting my thoughts together.  I hope to do that sometime in the not-too-distant future.)

     Hmmm.  A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cyc.com/employment.html&#34;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; if I ever want to leave academia?  OK, it&#39;s not moving &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; far, intellectually speaking.
&lt;p&gt;
(I think that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cyc.com/&#34;&gt;Cyc&lt;/a&gt; project, understood as a means to Artificial Intelligence, is deeply flawed, but that&#39;s a view based on a reasonably swift reading of what they&#39;re doing.  The other stuff, like being a purveyor of &#34;formalized common sense&#34; seems rather hokey, but valuable.)

 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, June 07, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#311759&#34;&gt;6:41 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;

He packed out the
second largest theatre on campus, and he spoke clearly and movingly about
the current reconciliation process: about how he was hesitant about it
all at the start (as it seemed to put the onus on aborigines to reconcile
themselves to the current situation, more than we as a nation reconciling
ourselves with our wronged brothers and sisters), how he&#39;s been encouraged
to see what&#39;s happening on the ground in places like Kempsie, and Mackay,
how he was moved to see the march on the bridge, and the outpourings of
interest and concern in local communities everywhere over Australia, and
how he thinks that the process will continue, even given the recalcitrance
of our political masters at a Federal level.
&lt;p&gt;
Then he spoke about possibilities for future work: he spoke about the 
possibility of a treaty or some other document.  This was when it clicked
for me a little more.  He explained about the legal lacuna in our own
situation.  We agree that the aborigines had sovereignty over the continent
before 1788, we agree that the Australian state has sovereignty now, and
we agree that the only ways to transfer sovereignty are conquest or 
treaty.  We deny that there was a conquest.  We do not have a treaty.
How did this transfer of rights happen?  So, treaties are on the 
agenda.  This was his only disappointment about the current work
of the reconciliation council.  He described how they were constituted
to do the groundwork for a community-wide discussion about a treaty,
and they haven&#39;t done this.  (No doubt they were so constituted because
the Labor government didn&#39;t want to think about it themselves, and 
the transition to the Conservatives has spooked them badly, but still.)
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, the talk was great, the discussion was encouraging, and I left
reassured that the discussion will continue, and that there is a 
groundswell of opinion which will mean that we will eventually get this
right.  Or at least, a lot righter than it is at present.
&lt;p&gt;
Only time will tell if my reassurance is justified.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, June 06, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#307456&#34;&gt;9:46 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;307456&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Let me wade in where angels fear to tread.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/2000_06_01_archive.html&#34;&gt;Russ Young has problems&lt;/a&gt; with the line of reasoning found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barbelith.com/2000_05_28_xeno.htm#286340&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in an open letter to Dr. Laura, about her condemnation of homosexuality.
&lt;p&gt;
Not wanting to judge at all in this debate, I  just want to point out that Russ&#39;s judgement that the open letter is a logical fallacy is completely mistaken.  He misreads the argument as a simple appeal against what he calls &#34;biblical authority&#34;.  It needn&#39;t be read in that way at all.  The letter, which simply asks Dr. Laura to apply lots of other interesting commands from the Torah, does not fail on matters of relevance.  If you wish to judge the argument on matters of validity, it seems that what&#39;s going on is something like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If regulations in Torah are applicable today, we ought do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s not the case that we ought do  &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;(In fact, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; seem quite silly, really.)&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, regulations in Torah are not applicable today.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, if your reasons against homosexuality are found in  the regulations Torah, then this argument has bite.  It certainly seems relevant to me.  (It&#39;s not as fun phrased in this way, but still, it was criticised on &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; grounds, and this is an occupational hazard when it comes to logic.)   Note too, that it&#39;s not an argument against scriptural authority &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.  It&#39;s a question about the applicability of laws in Torah.  
&lt;p&gt;
Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; this isn&#39;t the end of the story, or of the argument.  But that, I&#39;ll leave to others.
&lt;p&gt;
Back to your previously scheduled programming.

This will replace &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ansto.gov.au/&#34;&gt;ANSTO&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s old nuclear reactor, and be used for nuclear medicine, and other research purposes.
&lt;p&gt;
Unsurprisingly, the residents of Lucas Heights are not particularly happy that the new reactor will be sited &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ansto.gov.au/ansto/dir.html&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;.  Also unsurprisingly, I&#39;m happy that I live (and work) nowhere near there.  But scanning that map, I notice that I live rather close to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ansto.gov.au/natfac/cyc.html&#34;&gt;National Medical Cyclotron&lt;/a&gt;.  That doesn&#39;t seem to be such a problem, as people don&#39;t seem to be carting uranium or plutonium up and down Parramatta Road.

On matters Aboriginal, I&#39;ve been touched by reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foss.jcu.edu.au/profiles/staffing/person.cfm?ID=23&#34;&gt;Henry Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&#39; &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1864485817/&#34;&gt;This Whispering in our Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, his moving account of the white humanitarians who protested against the treatment of aborigines during the first century of the invasion of this country.  There&#39;s absolutely no question that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; knew that what we were doing in invading this country was wrong.  There was no treaty, there was no settlement, there was no just compact with the indigenous people of this land.  The moral relativism of our Prime Minister, in asserting that we cannot judge our forebears because the standards were different in their days, is not only rather surprising for a conservative like him, but is put to shame by the &#39;whispering in our hearts&#39; that Reynolds uncovers.  If you&#39;re interested in immigrant/indigenous relations, read this book!
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eod.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Knauss&lt;/a&gt; is not just humourous.  His &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eod.com/archive/date.html?DATE=20000603&#34;&gt;I made someone disappear yesterday&lt;/a&gt; is a moving vignette on transience.

     A &lt;a href=/web/20031011094411/http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/fishes/%22%22&gt;friend of mine&lt;/a&gt; from way back has just released &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/fishes/prodigal/default.html&#34;&gt;The Prodigal Project&lt;/a&gt;, with other friends of his.  It looks great from here.  I hope to pick up the Book and CD soon.

     &lt;em&gt;Sleeping in&lt;/em&gt; is a good thing.  When you wake up, and know that you&#39;ve slept as much as you need to, you know that you can face anything in the day ahead.  
&lt;p&gt;
When the day ahead includes marking two Ph.D. theses, you&#39;re not too sure that you can face &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.  But these two theses are quite enjoyable,
so I should survive the day with enough energy to cook my lentil moussaka and then entertain &lt;a href=&#34;http://datasearch.iim.uts.edu.au/education/ostaff/action.lasso?-database=edu%5fstaff%5fmain.fp3&amp;amp;-layout=websearch&amp;amp;-response=staffdetail.html&amp;amp;-recid=33481&amp;amp;-search&#34;&gt;my cousin Peter&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Wendy for dinner.
&lt;p&gt;
(I didn&#39;t get up at 3:30pm.  Sleeping in, for us is anything between 7am and 8am.  I&#39;m not a night owl.)

     The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/monads.htm&#34;&gt;Monads&lt;/a&gt; come up with such musical gems as  &lt;em&gt;Meinongian Babe Sitting in a Bar&lt;/em&gt; with lines like: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/meinongi.htm&#34;&gt;There&#39;s an infinity of possible worlds&lt;br&gt;
So why can&#39;t you be in one with me?&lt;br&gt;
So why can&#39;t you be in one with me?
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
You can download lots of philosophical songs in their MP3 glory &lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/sad.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
The chorus of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/anodeto.htm&#34;&gt;An Ode to Modus Ponens&lt;/a&gt; is quite compelling.  I never thought that you could sing
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If P, then Q&lt;br&gt;
Not Q&lt;br&gt;
Not P
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
so touchingly.  Wow.  If &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt; keeps sending me links this good, I&#39;ll give up browsing myself and just follow him around.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jbum.com/jbum/public_opinion.html&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is one way to do research.  Apparently pluralsim beats monism by roughly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jbum.com/jbum/public_opinion.html&#34;&gt;25 to 8&lt;/a&gt;.

     Would you eat &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;synthetic meat&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;p&gt;
Here&#39;s a snippet from the article
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Quietly, researchers are working on what may be the greatest alteration in the food chain since the first time a big fish swallowed a little fish--a system in which steaks, chops, and poultry are obtained without raising or killing animals.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but I don&#39;t eat very much meat.  (I rarely cook with any meat.)  My two main objections to high meat consumption are health concerns and the over-intensive agricultural process used in order to get the food to the person.  It&#39;s just not sustainable to regularly feed over 5 billion people lots of hunks of cow, pig and chicken.  It seems like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; process is even worse, adding another layer of high-tech heavy industry to the process.  Will we ever learn to &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1875989463/&#34;&gt;touch this earth lightly&lt;/a&gt; again?
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Thursday, June 01, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;288515&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Well, for what it&#39;s worth, I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/misc/faithandlogic.html&#34;&gt;written up&lt;/a&gt;
what I thought of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fpcr.org/blue_banner_articles/WCF_Logic.htm&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to.  I&#39;m not really happy with what I&#39;ve written so far.  It describes why I don&#39;t like the article, and what&#39;s wrong with it, but it doesn&#39;t say very much positive at all.  I&#39;d like to say something positive, but for that, I&#39;ll need to think some more.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;d appreciate any comments you have, but be warned, the prose is pretty thick, and you need an interest in both theology and logic to get something out of it.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ll now return you to your previously scheduled programming.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;286858&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     The NY Times gives us a little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/053000sci-physics-light.html&#34;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; on the faster than light caper I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#282507&#34;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You can get the impression of sending information superluminally even though you&#39;re not sending information
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Oh for an idea of what physicists &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; by the phrase &#34;sending information.&#34;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[(These are entries from my blog from 2000 and early 2001. They were originally hosted on a small server at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;Macquarie University&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the links are dead now, but I have kept them as they are here, for nostalgia&amp;rsquo;s sake.)

 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, May 31, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#283969&#34;&gt;6:06 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;283969&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Sometimes the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.megnut.com/misc/eminenya.mp3&#34;&gt;whole&lt;/a&gt; is much better than the sum of its parts.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2000_05_01_archive.inc&#34;&gt;Megnut&lt;/a&gt;
supplies &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.megnut.com/misc/eminenya.mp3&#34;&gt;eminenya.mpg&lt;/a&gt;, which is very much more than the sum of its consistuents.  
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#283927&#34;&gt;5:45 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;283927&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     There&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metafilter.com/detail.cfm?link_ID=1868&#34;&gt;helpful discussion&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metafilter.com/&#34;&gt;Metafilter&lt;/a&gt; on answering email.  The question at issue is: &lt;em&gt;What&#39;s a reasonable amount of time, for you, to expect someone to reply to an email?&lt;/em&gt;  Good question.  It really depends on the person, I think.  But knowing what &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people&#39;s expectations are helps me know how to treat the emails I get.
&lt;p&gt;
But remember: it&#39;s a person at the other end.  It&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;Good Thing&lt;/em&gt; to treat people with respect.  (This is why I feel so bad when I&#39;m such a &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt; email correspondent sometimes.  The emails languishing in my &lt;em&gt;To Do&lt;/em&gt; boxes burn a hole in my conscience too.)
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     Hmmm.  Light might go &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/05/30/MN26514.DTL&#34;&gt;faster than light&lt;/a&gt; through some substances.  &lt;em&gt;Three hundred times faster&lt;/em&gt;.  Now to figure out what that experiment actually means.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fpcr.org/blue_banner_articles/WCF_Logic.htm&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
on a reformed Christian perspective on logic.  I&#39;m a Christian (but not as &#34;reformed&#34; as many), and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl&#34;&gt;logician&lt;/a&gt; (but not as &#34;straight&#34; as many), and I think I disagree with this article on both religious and logical grounds.  Perhaps I will write something short up in response.  But not tonight.  Tonight I will relax.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;280391&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Found on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metafilter.com/&#34;&gt;Metafilter&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carfree.com/&#34;&gt;Carfree&lt;/a&gt; is a manifesto for cities without cars.  I like this, as I&#39;m a fan of public transport and minimising car usage.  The site has more information on how to construct a car-free city from scratch than on how to help transform your city into one which depends less on cars.
&lt;p&gt;
Alas, our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au/&#34;&gt;rail network&lt;/a&gt; is in crisis, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au/&#34;&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt; will not make things any easier.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crikey.com.au/&#34;&gt;Crikey&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/walkinghoward.html&#34;&gt;startlingly good article&lt;/a&gt; on the significance of the Corroboree 2000 bridge walk.  Reconciliation between blackfellas and whitefellas is a long way off if we don&#39;t go on to tangible results and structural societal changes.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I&#39;ve collected some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/images/Corroboree2000/index.html&#34;&gt;images of Corroboree 2000&#39;s bridge walk&lt;/a&gt; here.  It was a stunning day.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;273922&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbs.com.au/&#34;&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt; News tonight, it was at least 250,000 who walked across the bridge.  That&#39;s pretty significant.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

It was exciting to be a part of a huge crowd, all in good spirits, all showing that we feel that it&#39;s important to be involved in reconciliation with the indigenous people of this country.  I&#39;ll be interested to see the media reports of the size of the crowd.  It was packed even when we went, at about 11:30am.  I think that we exceeded the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reconciliation.org.au/&#34;&gt;council for reconciliation&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s expectations of 100,000 for the day.
&lt;p&gt;
Let&#39;s hope and pray that this sends a message to our recalcitrant leaders who won&#39;t accept that we as a nation have to say sorry for the damage done, in order to set things right for our future together.

     Mmmmm.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ozcoffee.com.au/index.html&#34;&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt;.  Very nice.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#258136&#34;&gt;10:55 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;258136&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I&#39;m noticing people coming in to this log searching for &lt;em&gt;Crimenet&lt;/em&gt;.  This is because of my earlier two posts (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#196349&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#212585&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). 
&lt;p&gt;I heard on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/&#34;&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crimenet.com.au/&#34;&gt;Crimenet&lt;/a&gt; is changing its access policy to make things more restrictive.  So, I go and I look at the site and find no change to the policies yet.  On the contrary, the search for criminal academics and I find two new things:  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;, the search is zippy.  They&#39;ve thrown more server power at it.  It&#39;s actually useable now.  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;, now there are only &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; criminal academics as opposed to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#212585&#34;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; I found last time.  (But there&#39;s &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; information about why suspect number four dropped out of the database.  Another thing to increase the suspicion.)
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, and one more thing.  Why is the &lt;em&gt;Unabomber&lt;/em&gt; (Ted Kaczynski) one of the three people they record as an academic with a criminal record?  Were any of his crimes committed under Australian jurisdiction?
Not necessarily.  If you read the fine print  on Crimenet&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crimenet.com.au/cgi-bin/cnet/allegro.pl?serve20000429191837.about.html&#34;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;, you find that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have a team of dedicated staff gathering information on crime, criminals, con artists and tricksters from around Australia and around the world. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So now I get to not only know the names of who I should be possibly worried about, but I also have no idea of whether they&#39;re in Australia or not?
&lt;p&gt;
If I were of a suspicious mind, I would think that they&#39;ve had to pad their database with as many entries as they can, whether relevant and in their remit or not.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, May 23, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#254869&#34;&gt;4:50 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;254869&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Why is it that my page comes up &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; on a Hotbot search for &lt;a href=&#34;http://hotbot.lycos.com/?MT=con%20air%20sountrack&amp;amp;SQ=1&amp;amp;TR=3&amp;amp;x=53&amp;amp;y=13&#34;&gt;con air sountrack&lt;/a&gt;?  I do know that as of now my page has 29 instances of the string &#34;con&#34; (none as a single word), two instances of &#34;air&#34; and none of &#34;soundtrack&#34; (though the 
webcrawler probably hit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#193827&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; entry when it was on the main page; and it&#39;s manifestly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about the &lt;em&gt;Con Air&lt;/em&gt; sountrack). 

&lt;p&gt;
Well, websurfer who got to my log page by way of a search for Con Air&#39;s sountrack, I hope you liked what you found!
&lt;p&gt;
This log item was brought to you by my ever enjoyable referer logs.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#254211&#34;&gt;1:18 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;254211&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     This is scary.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sandline.com/site/index.html&#34;&gt;Sandline&lt;/a&gt; have a nice website with training information, white papers, and a company profile.  Hire your own &lt;em&gt;Private Military Company&lt;/em&gt; today.
&lt;p&gt;
I find this sort of corporatisation of military &#34;services&#34; scary.  Not that it&#39;s a new thing.  And not that governments use military force in particularly ethical ways.
&lt;p&gt;
To come to think of it: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; do I find this scary?  I think I&#39;ll need to worry about this some more if I&#39;m to come to a considered view.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result, there&#39;s nothing interesting to link to today.  (Not that I mind this &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;.)
&lt;p&gt;
Instead, I have redrafted a &lt;a href=&#34;ftp://www.phil.mq.edu.au/pub/grestall/constructive.pdf&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, browsed through bookshops, enjoyed nice coffees, eaten at a great restaurant, watched too many &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snpp.com/&#34;&gt;Simpsons&lt;/a&gt; episodes, sat in front of a wood fire getting toasty, and enjoyed fine company.  What more could I ask for?
&lt;p&gt;
The picture on the right is Sydney&#39;s new rail station at the international airport.  I think I will be seeing more of this.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;244520&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Today, after shopping at the Salamanca Place Markets (with heaps of Tasmanian timber in view, almost all of it exquisite, despite the tendency of half of the stall owners to cover it up with tacky add-ons) I&#39;ve spent an hour or so fiddling with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/applescript/&#34;&gt;AppleScript&lt;/a&gt;.  URL Access Scripting really is neat.  I&#39;ve got uploading to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/&#34;&gt;web pages&lt;/a&gt; all automated now.  Very neat.
&lt;p&gt;
For an example of what some scriptable applications can do, check Apple&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/applescript/stone/create.html&#34;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stone.com/&#34;&gt;Stone Design&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Create&lt;/em&gt;.  Just beautiful.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supertectonics.com/&#34;&gt;SuperTectonics&lt;/a&gt; got around to answering my question about the Olympics.  (It&#39;s amazing what the threat of negative publicity will do for a motivation.  Not that anyone reads this site or anything!)  I&#39;ll leave the answer for you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supertectonics.com/2000_05_14_superarchives.htm&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; but here is an excerpt.
&lt;blockquote&gt;a shocking majority of sixty-two percent confessed that they were hoping to witness a stray javelin careen into the crowd and sink into the jellied flesh of a &#34;lazy American tourist&#34;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is good to know.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#241284&#34;&gt;9:06 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;241284&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Today was fun.  JC and I presented our paper to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.utas.edu.au/docs/humsoc/philosophy/index.html&#34;&gt;UTas Philosophy Department&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it clarified our thoughts on paraconsistency and pluralism quite a bit.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Thursday, May 18, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

     Tectonics has moved (and upgraded) to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supertectonics.com/&#34;&gt;SuperTectonics.&lt;/a&gt;
Despite their tagline alleging to &#34;Know Anything&amp;#153;&#34;, and despite &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#197283&#34;&gt;my earlier claims&lt;/a&gt; to this effect, it appears that they do not.
&lt;p&gt;
I posted them a question on May 5, asking why people are stupid enough to want the Olympics in their own city.  Apparently this was too difficult for them to answer.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;

     It&#39;s good to hear that Apple seem to be doing good things with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx&#34;&gt;MacOS X&lt;/a&gt;.  The new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/theater/dock_movie.html&#34;&gt;Dock&lt;/a&gt; implementation seems more sensible to me.  
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m just hanging out for a reasonably easy to use, rock-solid (or &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; rock solid) system to use on my machines so I can keep concentrating on work, and not worry about what the computer is doing.  One day this might happen.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m down in Hobart with &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/katrina.html&#34;&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; (and, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/cats.html&#34;&gt;Tarski and G&amp;ouml;del&lt;/a&gt;).  The weather is beautiful, cooler than Sydney, and crisp and fresh.  The place is extremely dry, however, and bushfires seem like a constant possibility.
&lt;p&gt;
Updates on this page will be infrequent, as I&#39;ll be spending time working and talking, and eating and only occasionally browsing the web. But, your loss (whoever you are) is my gain.   Any activity will probably be posted on our &lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com/&#34;&gt;work log&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;p&gt;
(JC wanted to know where I got my nice translucent menus on my PowerBook.  Well, JC, Greg Landweber&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kaleidoscope.net/greg/PowerWindows.html&#34;&gt;PowerWindows&lt;/a&gt; does the trick.)
&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully, we&#39;ll get lots of &lt;a href=&#34;http://pluralism.pitas.com/&#34;&gt;work done&lt;/a&gt; while we are enjoying ourselves.

     Great.  Now the ftp daemon is all there, but the http server on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;www.mq.edu.au&lt;/a&gt; (and as a result, the virtual host &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;www.phil.mq.edu.au&lt;/a&gt;, which is just a directory on www.mq.edu.au) is down.  I can post here, but you can&#39;t read it.
&lt;p&gt;
[Added at 4pm.  It&#39;s back up, as you can tell by reading this.]
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a name=&#34;224756&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Well, the ftp daemon is back at last.  I can update the log, and update my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/&#34;&gt;webpages&lt;/a&gt;.  
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I&#39;ve &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; finished Draft 1 of &lt;a href=&#34;ftp://www.phil.mq.edu.au/pub/grestall/constructive.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constructive Logic for All&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but I can&#39;t put it up on my server, as it seems that its ftp daemon is hosed.  But then, if &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; blog entry gets up, it isn&#39;t hosed, and the paper should be there very soon after this is posted.  Hmmm...
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m glad it got done, anyway.

     I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; browsing the web while avoiding work.  I just took a sideways glance at the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/&#34;&gt;A List Apart&lt;/a&gt; issue, with a great &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeldman.com/&#34;&gt;Zeldman&lt;/a&gt; story on the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sylloge.com/5k/original.html&#34;&gt;5k&lt;/a&gt; challenge&lt;/a&gt;.  Go &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/stories/5k/index.html&#34;&gt;read it&lt;/a&gt; to find out about the web-design equivalent of haiku.

     The paper is not finished.  No more interesting weblogging for me until it is.  First, however, a game of squash with my friend, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macarthur.uws.edu.au/AEGIS/staff-%20brian.html&#34;&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;.

     Inspiriation struck last night.  My paper is sketched out, and today I fill in the details.  I&#39;ll be back on the net when it&#39;s time to upload the first draft.  I promise.
&lt;p&gt;
Now to find some appropriate &lt;em&gt;writing music&lt;/em&gt;.

Lots done on the list, and there are quite a few books ready to go back to the library.   I just need one flash of inspiration and a solid day&#39;s work to complete the paper I&#39;m working on.

     I finally managed to complete my Crimenet search for academics with criminal records I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#196349&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. (To recap: Crimenet is a commercially maintained database of criminal activity in Australia.  I was searching for academics with criminal records.)  I was presented with a screen featuring three names: three names from the database marked as academics and people with criminal records.  I would have had to pay a small fee to see the Crimenet files for these three individuals to see what the database records these individuals as having actually &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;.  All I was presented with was three unannotated names.  I declined forking over my cash to see the details.
&lt;p&gt;
After seeing it (I didn&#39;t recognise any of the individuals) I became convinced that this way of presenting the information is altogether reprehensible.  I get for free an uninformed suspicion about named individuals.  I have to &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; to get this suspcion informed and clarified. For all I know, these charges could be &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, and most possibilities are completely harmless.  Yet, knowing what I know, I cannot be sure.  Paranoia comes for free.  
&lt;p&gt;
This is no surprise, because creating a paranoid public is very much in the company&#39;s interest.  
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     The last few days has seen me build up a few important deadlines, after a long sabbatical almost completely deadline-free.  I&#39;m actually enjoying having my to-do list fill up, and having to plan to get everything done.  I wonder how long this will last.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This historic issue contains the Human Genome Project&#39;s latest success, the 
sequencing of human Chromosome 21 by a Japanese-German team. Chromosome 21 
contains genes linked to illnesses including Alzheimer&#39;s, Down&#39;s Syndrome, 
epilepsy, and leukaemia, so its sequencing should open the gates to great 
advances in understanding and finding cures for these devastating 
conditions.

&lt;p&gt;
I seem to be collecting more of them.  I don&#39;t know where, or how, or why, but I have a pile of over 30 books on my desk, all not finished with.  I think it&#39;s time to get off the net and to plow through a few more of them.
&lt;p&gt;
And to get my writing done.
&lt;p&gt;
But first, I must retrieve a ping-pong ball from under the sofa before Erasmus gets to it by scratching &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the furniture.

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; arrived at last.  (One advantage of being antipodeal is that when you order from a large &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;ecommerce&lt;/a&gt; firm and pay for surface delivery {because air delivery is rather expensive} then you have time for &lt;em&gt;forget&lt;/em&gt; what you ordered by the time it arrives.  It&#39;s like a present from your former self.)  Anyway, yesterday&#39;s package was a present consisting of &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1575861933/&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/0674001877/&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;first,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1575861933/&#34;&gt;Situations and Attitudes&lt;/a&gt;, I have already read.  It&#39;s the groundbreaking work by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-vil.cs.indiana.edu/barwise.html&#34;&gt;Barwise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/&#34;&gt;Perry&lt;/a&gt;.  It proposes a new (well, it was new in the 1980&#39;s) semantic theory which takes situations and context as crucial, especially in the treatment of attitude reports, like belief and knowledge reports, and reports of perception.  The reprint is cheap, and good for my bookshelf.  

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; is the thousand page tome &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/0674001877/&#34;&gt;The Sociology of Philosophies&lt;/a&gt;.  To quote the blurb
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Through network diagrams and sustained narrative, sociologist Randall Collins traces the development of philosophical thought from ancient Greece to modern Europe. Collins provides a self-reflexive sociological philosophy of intellectual life that opens a new path beyond relativism and realism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well, I don&#39;t know if the right sort of contrast is between relativism and realism, but then, sociologists usually mean different things by these terms.  What I want the book for is its encyclopedic sweep of philosophical history, and his analysis of how philosophical schools grow, develop, clash and die out.  The &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; in the book is amazing, and there&#39;s lots of food for thought for me; because I&#39;m trying to understand the context I work in.
&lt;p&gt;
Context, context, context.

     Erasmus is busy getting herself tangled in a ball of wool as I write this.  She&#39;s done this before, and she&#39;s much better at untangling herself from it than I am at untangling the modem cord.  Perhaps I can employ her as a professional cord untangler.  There&#39;s one catch: she perfers playing to her own time over working to mine.  She&#39;s very cute with it, of course.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcs.net/%7Erusaerog/boosters/buran.html&#34;&gt;Buran&lt;/a&gt;, a Russian Space Shuttle test vehicle has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.suburbia.com.au/~colinc/buran/buran2.jpg&#34;&gt;come to Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.   It will be on display at the old harbour casino site for at least two years from Mid-June, according to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/&#34;&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;. More of the story can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-021000a.html&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which includes this surprising tidbit:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, in 1998, the Buran 002 was offered for sale through websites such as www.spacehardware.com. Listed at $10 million, the shuttle was also posted at least once to the popular online auction site eBay, though no serious offers were received.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
More photographs can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.suburbia.com.au/~colinc/buran/buran.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and more information about Buran and its place in the former Soviet space industry is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.friends-partners.org/~mwade/craft/buran.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.buran.com.au/&#34;&gt;Buran company website&lt;/a&gt;, from the Australians who bought the thing and will be showing it, seems to have a number of shortcomings.  First, there&#39;s precious little content there, especially in the HTML version (don&#39;t get me started about the ridiculous shockwave animations).  Second, it&#39;s all in that kitsch retro Soviet art style, which is to be expected, but shows little imagination.  Third, the navigation window doesn&#39;t give you much of an idea of what the content is where (what &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; is the difference between the control tower, the communication room and the launch pad? ).  Finally, the server doesn&#39;t seem to be particularly able to handle the load since the news broke some days ago.

These are her from the week before last.  There she&#39;s 8 weeks old, and her shaved side from the desexing is clearly visible in the bottom picture.  The hair is growing back quickly now.

&lt;p&gt;In the central picture she&#39;s contemplating her prime adversary: the coloured ping-pong ball.   Now she&#39;s adept at sneaking up on it, hiding behind things so it can&#39;t see her, and keeping her bell silent to it can&#39;t hear her.  She&#39;s quite the hunter.  The ping-pong ball still manages to get away from her grip, so the chase continues.

alt=&#34;[night on earth]&#34; width=&#34;162&#34; height=&#34;236&#34; border=&#34;1&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crimenet.com.au/&#34;&gt;Crimenet&lt;/a&gt;
is the world&#39;s first site to provide a complete information service on criminal records, stolen property, missing persons, wanted persons, con artists and unsolved crimes.
&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s been lots of discussion about this site here in Australia in the last week, since its opening.  The database behind the website is a collection of freely available information: court records, information about scams from the media (all checked for 
accuracy, according to the owners) and police informion about unsolved crimes.  The information is all there in an easy to access form, some of it free, and some of it available for a small fee.  You can access the criminal database and search for data on past crimes by all manner of relevant properties.  (Location, Kind of Crime, or Name.  Most odd, however is the search by `occupation&#39;:  you can search for crimse committed by Bank Managers, Sportspeople, or Media Personalities, and even &lt;em&gt;Academics&lt;/em&gt;.)  It is a reasonably comprehensive database of crimes committed in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now why do people have a problem with this?  The information is all there on the public record anyway.  Why should people be concerned about this database?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer should be clear.  The information is publically available, for sure, but in nothing like this form.  We make phone directories publically available, but we don&#39;t like it when people sell databases of phone numbers linked to addresses.  It&#39;s all too easy to abuse this by searching for phone numbers attached to addresses, and to use this to do &lt;em&gt;bad things&lt;/em&gt;: such as phoning down a street to see who&#39;s away from home to see which are the good places to break and enter.  All this is well enough known.  The mere fact that the information is publically available doesn&#39;t entail that it is permissible to make it available
in any form.  If people can track your criminal record with such ease, this will change your life in a way like nothing before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem for us in the future is that information will become more and more manipulable in these ways.  We will be confronted by new ways to use the information already available to us, and this will change the world we live in.&lt;/p?
&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this database is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; popular that I&#39;ve never 
been able to access it successfully, and so I don&#39;t yet know which other academics I should be worrying about.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Last night&#39;s soundtrack: &lt;a href=&#34;http://rick.stanford.edu/opera/Britten/bio.html&#34;&gt;Benjamin Britten&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfbach.org/rejoiceinthelamb.html&#34;&gt;Rejoice in the Lamb&lt;/a&gt;.  The best lines:
&lt;blockquote style=&#34;font-size:80%&#34;&gt;
For I will consider my cat Jeoffry.&lt;br&gt;
For he is the servant&lt;br&gt;
of the living God,&lt;br&gt;
duly and daily serving him.&lt;br&gt;
For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East&lt;br&gt;
he worships in his way.&lt;br&gt;
For this is done&lt;br&gt;
by wreathing his body&lt;br&gt;
seven times round&lt;br&gt;
with elegant quickness.&lt;br&gt;
For he knows&lt;br&gt;
that God is his saviour.&lt;br&gt;
For God has bless&#39;d him&lt;br&gt;
in the variety&lt;br&gt;
of his movements.&lt;br&gt;
For there is nothing sweeter&lt;br&gt;
than his peace when at rest.&lt;br&gt;
For I am possessed of a cat,&lt;br&gt;
surpassing in beauty,&lt;br&gt;
from whom I take occasion&lt;br&gt;
to bless Almighty God.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Canon Hussey wrote in an introductory note to the first
performance
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The words of the Cantata are taken from a long poem of the same name.  The writer was &lt;a href=&#34;http://209.1.224.11/CollegePark/1305/poet_smart.html&#34;&gt;Christopher Smart&lt;/a&gt;, and eighteenth-century poet, deeply religious, but of a strange and unbalanced mind. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sometimes in a crazy world it&#39;s appropriate to respond with a strange and unbalanced mind.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I&#39;ve caved in and joined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anthonyjhicks.com/aussieblogs/&#34;&gt;aussieblogs&lt;/a&gt; webring.  Now the other sites in that ring will benefit from the &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; flow-through from this high-powered site!
&lt;p&gt;

It changes the face of people getting together, at least in large groups.

     &lt;a name=&#34;190504&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Well, yesterday I got a reasonable amount of work done.  Most fun was sending off copies of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; to some colleagues and teachers who helped me in various ways during its preparation.  I hope they like it!
&lt;p&gt;
Also fun was updating my computers (the office &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/imac/&#34;&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; and the home &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macos/&#34;&gt;MacOS 9&lt;/a&gt;.  I spent too long playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/speech/&#34;&gt;speakable items&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s fun, for a short while, to get your computer to check your email by telling it to &#34;check my mail&#34; but then it feels rather stupid.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#188924&#34;&gt;12:20 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;188924&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Check the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shift.com/shiftstd/html/onlineTOC/2000/8.2/html/Gates1.html&#34;&gt;Bill Gates Makeover&lt;/a&gt;.  I found this courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bryanboyer.com/&#34;&gt;Bryan Boyer&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; insightful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bryanboyer.com/today.html?c=daily/050100.data&#34;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; on what we think of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and the function of style in this (what I seem to like to call, without much justification) late capitalist society.
&lt;p&gt;
Why no justification in calling this late capitalism?  Simply because we might well not be near the end of it.  Perish the thought.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt; tells me that some people can&#39;t get into the OED &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd&#34;&gt;Word of the Day&lt;/a&gt;
without having an account with the OED.&lt;p&gt;
Hmmm.  It worked for me this morning, but it doesn&#39;t work now.  Curiouser and curiouser.

&lt;p&gt;
I don&#39;t think that includes much web surfing, so updates here will be slow to nonexistent.  
&lt;p&gt;
To keep you occupied, how about you try the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oed.com/&#34;&gt;OED&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;A href=&#34;http://www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd&#34;&gt;Word of the Day&lt;/A&gt;.  (Today&#39;s seems to be &#34;dictionary&#34;.  Hmmm.)

     I really ought to know more about this sort of thing: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parc.xerox.com/ops/members/brown/papers/university.html&#34;&gt;Universities in the Digital Age&lt;/a&gt;.  That&#39;s an excellent paper by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parc.xerox.com/ops/members/brown/jsb.html&#34;&gt;John Seely Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parc.xerox.com/ops/members/brown/pduguid.html&#34;&gt;Paul Duguid&lt;/a&gt;.  Their book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slofi.com/&#34;&gt;The Social Life of Information&lt;/a&gt; looks good too.  It gives a sociologically informed reading of information technology.

     For you, when you think that the net is just &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.personalization.com/soapbox/contributions/millar.asp&#34;&gt;Modern life is rubbish. QED. (And if you needed more proof, in Anthony Trollope&#39;s day you could post a letter from London to Cambridge in the morning, have a reply by lunchtime, respond to the reply and have a final message from Cambridge that night. Try that on hotmail). &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Modern life mightn&#39;t be 100% &lt;em&gt;rubbish&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myrtle.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Brian Millar&lt;/a&gt; has a point here.

     I occasionally check my referrer logs, both on the server, and through the little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nedstatbasic.net/&#34;&gt;nedstat&lt;/a&gt; icons I&#39;ve got squirrelled away on some of these pages.  Anyway, someone got to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; page by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://hotbot.lycos.com/&#34;&gt;hotbot&lt;/a&gt; search on &#34;inconsistent graham priest.&#34;  The reference was
&lt;blockquote style=&#34;font-size:75%&#34;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://hotbot.lycos.com/?MT=inconsistent+graham+priest&amp;amp;II=10&amp;amp;RPN=2&amp;amp;SQ=1&amp;amp;TR=334&#34;&gt;http://hotbot.lycos.com/?MT=inconsistent+graham+priest&amp;amp;II=10&amp;amp;RPN=2&amp;amp;SQ=1&amp;amp;TR=334&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I love it.
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, my page came up as number &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; after lots of curious, but completely irrelevant guff.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I&#39;m not a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s business practices, but I am looking forward to trying out the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macintouch.com/o2001.html&#34;&gt;PIM/Email Client&lt;/a&gt; in Office 2001.  It looks quite smart.

 &lt;h3&gt;Thursday, April 27, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     You might have to be Australian to understand &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chaser.com.au/archive/news/news11/democrats_hoax.htm&#34;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;
from the Chaser.  A quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We were pretty bitter at first - it takes a lot of effort to develop a Democrat puppet from scratch, but we just had to move on. I don&#39;t know who is operating Cheryl now, but when I see the footage on TV, I can&#39;t say that her movements and demeanour look terribly realistic.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The backstory: The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.democrats.org.au/&#34;&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; are a minor party in Australia&#39;s political life, positioned somewhere between the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alp.org.au/&#34;&gt;Labor party&lt;/a&gt; on the one hand and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nsw.liberal.org.au/&#34;&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npa.org.au/&#34;&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; on the other.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/member.asp?id=XW4&#34;&gt;Cheryl Kernot&lt;/a&gt; defected from the Democrats to the Labor party in 1997, but sunk from sight in the midst of media scrutiny, pressure and much speculation about her leadership ability and prospects in the faction-ridden Labor party.  She has never been the same.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

I see that I&#39;m going to have more distractions when I&#39;m working from home, but they will be most &lt;em&gt;enjoyable&lt;/em&gt; distractions.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;

     I&#39;ve taken delivery of &lt;em&gt;Erasmus Epiminides Restall Parker&lt;/em&gt;.  She&#39;s enjoying exploring our house now.  Let&#39;s see how long the sofa lasts being used as a scratching post. 

&lt;p&gt;Pictures at 11.  Well, it&#39;s more like there&#39;ll be pictures whenever I get them taken, developed, scanned and posted.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     &lt;a href=&#34;http://monkeyfist.com/&#34;&gt;Monkeyfist&lt;/a&gt; keeps getting better.  I&#39;ve only just noticed the neat category views: they even have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://monkeyfist.com/category/philosophy/brief&#34;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; view which helps me scan through their archives for directly relevant material.  

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     A &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; teen comedy movie coming from Australia?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alibrandi.com.au/&#34;&gt;Looking for Alibrandi&lt;/a&gt;
could well be it.  It previews well (saw the preview before the blander than expected &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mansfieldpark.com/&#34;&gt;Mansfield Park&lt;/a&gt;) and the website has a great section on &lt;em&gt;Wog Day Family Secrets&lt;/em&gt;.   Great Italian recipes.  Good sountrack.  Could be something to see.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     Even though &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theeye.com.au/&#34;&gt;The Eye&lt;/a&gt; has folded, there is still good independent Australian political comment and content on the web.  An article like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chaser.com.au/0019/united_nations.htm&#34;&gt;Australia to leave the UN
&#34;We weren&#39;t into unity anyway&#34;
&lt;/a&gt; might make you think that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chaser.com.au/&#34;&gt;The Chaser&lt;/a&gt; is an Australian clone of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theonion.com/&#34;&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt;, but there&#39;s more to it than that.  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crikey.com.au/&#34;&gt;Crikey&lt;/a&gt; seems like it is worth a look too.

She&#39;s a black/gold tabby, affectionate and not aggressive.  She&#39;s going to be microchipped and checked out by the vet today, and we pick her up tomorrow if she&#39;s OK.  Now to choose the name.  Current front-runners: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EpimenidesParadox.html&#34;&gt;Epimenides&lt;/e&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eur.nl/&#34;&gt;Erasmus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05617b.htm&#34;&gt;Eusebius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Yes, we know that they&#39;re all &lt;em&gt;male&lt;/em&gt; names, but  they are no longer in wide use, and they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; each both significant and stylish.

Robert Frank is great on radio, and I must read his &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/0684842343/&#34;&gt;Luxury Fever&lt;/a&gt;.  Boy I&#39;ve been enjoying &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/rn/&#34;&gt;Radio National&lt;/a&gt; lately.

     Hermann Weyl was wise.  He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are not very pleased when we are forced to accept a mathematical truth by virtue of a complicated chain of formal conclusions and computations, which we traverse blindly, link by link, feeling our way by touch.  We want first an overview of the aim and of the road; we want to understand the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of the proof, the deeper context.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unterrichtsblätter für Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften&lt;/em&gt;, 38, 177-188 (1932). Translation by Abe Shenitzer appeared in &lt;em&gt;The American Mathematical Monthly&lt;/em&gt;, v. 102, no. 7 (August-September 1995), p. 646.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The quote was found on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.furman.edu/~mwoodard/mqs/mquot.shtml&#34;&gt;Mathematical Quotation Server&lt;/a&gt;, which is full of other wise sayings.

     I am getting quite good (if I may say so) at making pumpkin soup.  (Not &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.starla.org/pumpkinsoup/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
sort of pumpkin soup, but more like &lt;a href=&#34;http://soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/soups/recipe1212.rec&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; kinds of pumpkin soup.)  The secret?  Good quality fresh pumpkin and a high pumpkin to stock ratio.  Once blended it will be rich and creamy.  Tarragon sets it off perfectly.   It&#39;s a good meal for a cool autumn night.

     False alarm.  We &lt;em&gt;attempted&lt;/em&gt; to get a cat, but the CPSNSW is shut until Wednesday, and the local pet store contained only one kitten, who appeared to be extremely lifeless.  Not exactly the alert companion we&#39;d like.  We will wait, patiently.

     Last night we went to our church&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Tennebrae&lt;/em&gt; service, a vigil of readings from John&#39;s gospel with candles extinguished as the story gets darker and darker until the crucifixion.  The combination of sight and sound and silence was utterly compelling.

I was there in time to see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/Gij_1.html&#34;&gt;Cornelius Gijsbrechts&lt;/a&gt; exhibition, which was a sheer delight.

I would have thought that all finite numbers were &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; closer to zero than to infinity.  Infinity is very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; big.  But then, I think, this thought expresses how we think about numbers.  Most of the ones we think about are small, and easily distinguished.    All the rest are &#34;close togther&#34; up there in the sky where the big numbers live (or wherever they are), and not too distinct. What&#39;s the difference between 100 billion and 1000 billion anyway?   

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Lovins et. al.&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/0316353167/&#34;&gt;Natural Capitalism&lt;/a&gt; sounds worthwhile: if we&#39;re going to measure things economically, we should at least do it realistically.

This is encouraging, because it means that my current work must take reality into account.  Now if only reality were more &lt;em&gt;compliant.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1925.txt&#34;&gt;In most cases this is a bad idea.&#34;&lt;/a&gt;

     Yesterday&#39;s work on realizability went well.  I think I&#39;ve got that down.  Today, I look at proof-theoretic justificatons of the logical constants.  This has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; appealed to me as a philosophical justification, but maybe there&#39;s something in it.

     To keep you occupied today, here&#39;s one more great Polish Art poster.  &lt;em&gt;Leningrad Cowboys&lt;/em&gt; was a great movie (we&#39;d call it `quirky&#39; if it were an Australian movie, but as it isn&#39;t...). &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; poster captures it well.  I love that hair.

I&#39;m heading off to try presenting Kleene&#39;s realizability semantics for intuitionistic logic in a way that a layperson can understand, and to explain why it proves results in &lt;em&gt;conflict&lt;/em&gt; with classical analysis.  Hmmm.  This is a tough job...

     &lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt; burned the cake.  I was too focussed on the web when I should have noticed that attractive &lt;em&gt;I&#39;m a ready to take out of the oven mud-cake&lt;/em&gt; smell.  Mmmmm.

     Since becoming a home owner, I&#39;ve started paying attention to architecture much more.  I&#39;m learning from the work of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.area.progetto-ed.it/AR34/c/c1.htm&#34;&gt;Glenn Murcutt&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Glen_Murcutt.html&#34;&gt;Australian Architect&lt;/a&gt; who calls us to &lt;a href=&#34;http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1875989463/&#34;&gt;touch this earth lightly&lt;/a&gt;.

     This morning it&#39;s more cake baking, house cleaning (friends coming over again, and the kitchen floor needs a clean), cheque depositing and in the time left over, I&#39;ll be doing more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;.  Today, more on constructivism.  Let&#39;s see whether I can make things clear to myself, at least.

     Why would &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.intelligenesis.net/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt; these people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; be interested in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/&#34;&gt;Substructural Logics&lt;/a&gt; book?  (Scouring through my access logs.)

     Got that javascript error sorted.  IE5 was set to log errors on this machine here, and  I tracked down the little error in the page counter script down the bottom of the page.  It&#39;s fixed now. Apologies if this error bit you too.

     A nice definition of the scientific method from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moonboy.com/sms/index.htm&#34;&gt;Science Made Stupid&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;p&gt;
The cornerstone of modern science is the &lt;em&gt;scientific method&lt;/em&gt;. Scientists first 
formulate &lt;em&gt;hypotheses&lt;/em&gt;, or predictions, about nature. Then they perform 
&lt;em&gt;experiments&lt;/em&gt; to test their hypotheses. There are two forms of scientific 
method, the &lt;em&gt;inductive&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;deductive&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;table border=&#34;0&#34; cellpadding=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&#34;top&#34;  class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;INDUCTIVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulate hypothesis
&lt;li&gt;apply for grant
&lt;li&gt;perform experiments or gather data to test hypothesis
&lt;li&gt;alter data to fit hypothesis
&lt;li&gt;publish
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&#34;top&#34;  class=&#34;sml&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEDUCTIVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulate hypothesis
&lt;li&gt;apply for grant
&lt;li&gt;perform experiments or gather data to test hypothesis
&lt;li&gt;revise hypothesis to fit data
&lt;li&gt;backdate revised hypothesis
&lt;li&gt;publish
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
This is truer than you might think.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spyonit.com/Home&#34;&gt;spyonit&lt;/a&gt;.  It makes routine web searching for updates automatic.  Let it know what web pages you want watched, and it will inform you when they change.

Nice style sheets.  Uniform design.  Edit in one place.  Now if only all browsers implemented them sensibly.  
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#130934&#34;&gt;8:26 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;130934&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I have the very good fortune to be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deepleap.com/&#34;&gt;DeepLeap&lt;/a&gt; alpha tester.  It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; very good.  It&#39;s already changed the way I browse.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, April 04, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#129904&#34;&gt;11:34 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;129904&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     We are very well served by our public broadcaster here.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/&#34;&gt;Foreign Correspondent&lt;/a&gt; is excellent journalism.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#129810&#34;&gt;9:39 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;129810&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.billybragg.co.uk/reach8.html&#34;&gt;Love is strange.  And you have to have to learn to take the crunchy with the smooth, I s&#39;pose.&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#129800&#34;&gt;9:25 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;129800&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     You can say a lot in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jjg.net/17s/&#34;&gt;seventeen syllables&lt;/a&gt;.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#129706&#34;&gt;6:59 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;129706&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     On the topic of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_04_01_archive.html#125413&#34;&gt;first post of today&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sony.com/&#34;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/&#34;&gt;Palm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/pr/111599-pqa.html&#34;&gt;licensee&lt;/a&gt;, so the PalmOS/MD player is within the realms of possibility.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#129692&#34;&gt;6:40 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;129692&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Played around this afternoon with Barwise and Etchemendy and Co.&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-csli.stanford.edu/LPL/&#34;&gt;Language, Proof and Logic&lt;/a&gt; software.  They&#39;ve done a good job of writing software to help students do elementary logic, but it is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; tedious to use.  So much clicking, typing, selecting, mousing around and generally moving your focus from the proof to the goals, to the button bar to the menu bar.  It is completely unnatural, compared to writing on a piece of paper (or a whiteboard for that matter).  There is so much more &lt;em&gt;bandwidth&lt;/em&gt; in the human/pen/paper interaction which there isn&#39;t in the human/(keyboard and mouse)/screen combination.  

&lt;p&gt;
Now that I think of it, this is one reason why using a Newton, despite its itty-bitty screen, is actually a liberating computing experience.  The jumping around the screen with a pen is much quicker than mousing/clicking/typing.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#129513&#34;&gt;4:20 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;129513&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Before the library I visited a nursery, and they had some delightful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.calamondin.com/&#34;&gt;calamondins&lt;/a&gt;.  A small one in a large pot would look great on our front verandah.  Especially matching the pale orange of our house.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#129492&#34;&gt;4:02 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;129492&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I picked up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coop-bookshop.com.au/cgi-bin/fcgi-books?_next_page_=GetSingleBook&amp;amp;_frames_=no&amp;amp;_key_=9780957758100&amp;amp;basket_name=306420&amp;amp;user_id=954949309353&amp;amp;_peek_start_=1&amp;amp;_peek_length_=25&#34;&gt;Coffee, Sex and Health
&lt;/a&gt; at my local library today.  It looks like an enjoyable read about the social history of coffee consumption in western societies.  

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#125413&#34;&gt;8:41 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;125413&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minidisc.org/mz-r110pda.htm&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
an April Fool&#39;s joke?  I only found it today, but it was posted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minidisc.org/&#34;&gt;www.minidisc.org&lt;/a&gt; on April 1.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Monday, April 03, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#123753&#34;&gt;12:36 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;123753&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fontbureau.com/designers/blokland.html&#34;&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.letterror.com/&#34;&gt;font&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.idirect.com/~nfhome/zapf.htm&#34;&gt;designers&lt;/a&gt; have such &lt;em&gt;style&lt;/em&gt;.  I am particularly enamoured of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petr.nl/asp/page/buro/products/proforma/e&#34;&gt;Proforma&lt;/a&gt; and its forthcoming sibling &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petr.nl/asp/page/buro/products/prolinea/e&#34;&gt;Prolinea&lt;/a&gt;.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Sunday, April 02, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#122546&#34;&gt;5:30 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;122546&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Christine&#39;s book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oup.co.uk/isbn/0-19-826841-6&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just Lawyers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is out.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oup.co.uk/&#34;&gt;OUP&lt;/a&gt; website has a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better way of referring to their catalogue than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.routledge.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Routledge&lt;/a&gt;, the publisher of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/&#34;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;m not confident that a link to Routledge&#39;s page won&#39;t break soon (it has once already since November).  OUP, on the other hand, seem to have done their website homework.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[(These are entries from my blog from 2000 and early 2001. They were originally hosted on a small server at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mq.edu.au&#34;&gt;Macquarie University&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the links are dead now, but I have kept them as they are here, for nostalgia&amp;rsquo;s sake.)

&lt;hr&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Friday, March 31, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#118699&#34;&gt;10:03 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;118699&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     OK.  Just a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; browsing while the cake is baking.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hermenaut.com/&#34;&gt;Hermenaut&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting browse: philosophers outside academia.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#118573&#34;&gt;9:03 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;118573&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     Quiet day today.  Baking a cake, writing a paper, and having people over for dinner &amp;amp; supper.  No more blogging today.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Thursday, March 30, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#116996&#34;&gt;3:37 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;116996&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     This afternoon&#39;s listening is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/music/planet/planet.htm&#34;&gt;The Planet&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/employment/9810/10/employment2.html&#34;&gt;Lucky Oceans&lt;/a&gt;.  Certainly my favourite voice on radio.  Rich and mellow.  

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#116526&#34;&gt;11:08 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;116526&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     This morning&#39;s listening: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/recordings/1591.html&#34;&gt;Alina&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/artists/111.html&#34;&gt;Arvo P&amp;amp;auml;rt&lt;/a&gt; is my composer of choice at present.  Divine simplicity.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#116248&#34;&gt;9:01 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;116248&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I have been enjoying taking pictures more on my last trip, but I don&#39;t particularly like my camera.  Some people have been pointing to the idiosyncratic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lomo.com/&#34;&gt;lomo camera&lt;/a&gt;.  But then there are those digital things.  Who knows.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Wednesday, March 29, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#115132&#34;&gt;11:48 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;115132&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backupbrain.com/&#34;&gt;Backup Brain&lt;/a&gt;
provides the new blogger &lt;a href=&#34;javascript:void(window.open(&#39;/web/20031011092441/http://www.blogger.com/blog_form_pop-up.pyra?b=nnnn&amp;amp;p=nnnn&amp;amp;u=&#39;+document.location.href+&#39;&amp;amp;n=&#39;+escape(document.getSelection()),&#39;bloggerForm&#39;,&#39;scrollbars=no,width=400,height=250,left=75,top=175&#39;))&#34;&gt;Blog This!&lt;/a&gt; bookmarklet for IE5/Mac.  This makes me actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the favourites bar on IE5.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#114834&#34;&gt;6:13 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;114834&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.powazek.com/&#34;&gt;powazek&lt;/a&gt;
redesign.  It is clear and clean, and &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; I prefer my sites I regularly visit to be frame-free.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Tuesday, March 28, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#112511&#34;&gt;4:09 PM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;112511&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.remogeneralstore.com/index.cfm?sponsor=0003332&#34;&gt;REMO General Store&lt;/a&gt; is soon open for business.  Remo was a &lt;em&gt;big thing&lt;/em&gt; here in Sydney, until they went out of business a few years ago.  Now, the phoenix emerges from the ashes, bigger and better -- and now on the net!  
They stock the best &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.remogeneralstore.com/alpha/product.cfm?pk=63&#34;&gt;t-shirts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.remogeneralstore.com/alpha/product.cfm?pk=121&#34;&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.remogeneralstore.com/alpha/random.cfm&#34;&gt;just about anything&lt;/a&gt;.

     &lt;/blockquote&gt;


 &lt;HR&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Monday, March 27, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;
 
     &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;datestamp&#34;&gt;
          &lt;a href=&#34;#109702&#34;&gt;9:15 AM&lt;/a&gt; ~ &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;a name=&#34;109702&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/rlinks.html&#34;&gt;Greg Restall | Research Links&lt;/a&gt; is my research links page.  I have been updating it lately, cleaning up the design; weeding out dead links; adding newer ones and categorising everyone.  It&#39;s work, but it makes the page more useable.
     &lt;/blockquote&gt;
