<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://consequently.org/news/2006/03/03/masses_of_formal_philosophy/">before</a>, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Vincent Hendricks and John Symons&rsquo; <a href="http://www.formalphilosophy.com/Masses/index.html">five questions about <em>Formal Philosophy</em></a>.  This seems like as good a place as any to answer them.  So, today, I&rsquo;ll have a crack at the most autobiographical of the questions:</p>

<h3 id="why-were-you-initially-drawn-to-formal-methods">Why were you initially drawn to formal methods?</h3>

<p>I suppose the natural way to interpret this question is something like &ldquo;why do formal methods rather than anything else in philosophy&rdquo; but in my case I&rsquo;d rather answer the related question &ldquo;why, given that you&rsquo;re interested in formal methods, apply them in philosophy rather than elsewhere.&rdquo;  I started off my academic life as an <a href="http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/">undergraduate student in mathematics</a>, because I was good at mathematics and studying it more seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>

<p>I enjoyed mathematics a great deal.  At the University of Queensland, where I was studying, there was a special cohort of &ldquo;Honours&rdquo; students right from the first year.  You were taught more research-oriented and rigourous subjects than were provided for the &ldquo;Pass&rdquo; students.  This meant that we had a small cohort of students, who knew each other pretty well, studied together and learned a lot.  I could see myself making an academic career in mathematics. (I surely couldn&rsquo;t see myself doing anything other than an academic career.  Being around the university was too much fun.)</p>

<p>However, there was a fly in the ointment.  I was doing well in my studies, but I was losing the <em>feel</em> for a great deal of the mathematics I was doing.  Applied mathematics went first, and analysis soon after.  I could do the work, but I didn&rsquo;t <em>understand</em> it.  I wrote assignments by matching patterns from what I had written in my lecture notes, or what was in the text with what we were asked.  In exams, I just bashed away at the problem, sometimes when asked in an exam to prove that <em>A</em> = <em>B</em>, I&rsquo;d work at <em>A</em> from the top of a page and keep manipulating it until I&rsquo;d got stuck.  Then I&rsquo;d work <em>backwards</em> from <em>B</em>, hoping to meet at somewhere rather like where I&rsquo;d got stuck.  If I was honest, I&rsquo;d write &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to get from here to there&rdquo;.  If I was dishonest, I&rsquo;d just leave the transition unexplained.  Knowing what I know now about marking assignments, it doesn&rsquo;t suprise me that I did very well&hellip;</p>

<p>The areas where intuition and understanding lasted the longest (and which were most <em>fun</em>) were topology, probability theory, combinatorics, set theory and logic.  There were so few honours subjects I really <em>wanted</em> to do that in my last year I struck a deal with the mathematics department that I could do a reading course in logic with the newly arrived professor in the <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/hprc/index.html?page=19718">Philosophy Department</a>. The professor was <a href="http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#graham">Graham Priest</a>, and the reading course was my introduction to philosophical logic.</p>

<p>At the very same time as I was wondering how to continue with academic life, I was very involved in Christian student things: in the little group I was in, I ran study groups, I organised meetings, I wrote publicity material, and I did a <em>bucketload</em> of reading.  In particular, while trying to figure out what I believed about things (about a <em>lot</em> of things), I read a lot of philosophy of religion and other philosophy written by Christians.  I found the philosophy more interesting, more rigourous and more accessible than a great deal of the <em>theology</em> I had been reading.  This piqued my interest in doing more philosophy for myself.  I hadn&rsquo;t done much philosophy as an undergraduate (just two subjects), but I started trying to figure out how to do a major in Philosophy quickly, so that I could go on to postgraduate work in that field, rather than in mathematics.</p>

<p>It turned out that my work with Graham Priest went so well that I didn&rsquo;t need to do more undergraduate study in Philosophy to start postgraduate work.  (That semester course resulted in <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/">this paper</a>, my first genuine academic publication.) I was offered a place in the Ph.D. program on the strength of my background in mathematics.  I was free to pursue my interest in philosophy, and logic was the bridge.  This meant that I could use the formal, mathematical skills that I had learned, on topics that interested me, and that I <em>understood</em>.  The mathematics was simple and manageable, it was applied to interesting issues, and I got to hang around with philosophers, who are interesting people.</p>
