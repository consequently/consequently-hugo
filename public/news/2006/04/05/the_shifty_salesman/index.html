<p>Su Rogerson has brought to my attention a lovely rendition of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/">Curry&rsquo;s paradox</a>, due to <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp05320">Peter Geach</a>, in his <em>Reason and Argument</em> (Blackwell, 1976), pages 93&ndash;95.  The discussion takes place at a car yard.  I&rsquo;ll quote the discussion, interspersed with some commentary.  (I&rsquo;m quoting from a draft of Su Rogerson&rsquo;s thesis, and not from the text.  I&rsquo;ll check this for correctness when I have access to the volume.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Customer</em>: I&rsquo;ll buy the car only if, if I buy the car, you&rsquo;ll guarantee it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might suspect that this claim of the customer&rsquo;s is <em>not</em> the best starting point for a car purchase negotiation, and that rather too much is conceded straight away.  But that&rsquo;s not quite right.  The customer has only conceded that the guarantee (conditional on the purchase) is <em>necessary</em> for the purchase, not sufficient.  (The claim is an &lsquo;only if&rsquo; not an &lsquo;if&rsquo;.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: But let&rsquo;s suppose that if you buy the car, then I&rsquo;ll guarantee it: what then?</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: Then I&rsquo;ll buy the car.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the crucial concession.  It&rsquo;s all downhill from here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: Can I hold you to both the things you&rsquo;ve just said?</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: Certainly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The customer is going to regret saying that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: Then you are logically committed to buying the car anyhow, even if I don&rsquo;t guarantee it.</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: What?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The salesman is being a bit disingenuous at this point, but what he says is literally true, as we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: You say you&rsquo;ll by the car only on condition that if you buy the car I&rsquo;ll guarantee it?</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: Yes, I do say that: I&rsquo;m not a complete idiot!</p>

<p><em>Salesman</em>: Well then: if you&rsquo;ll buy the car, you&rsquo;ll buy the car only if I&rsquo;ll guarantee it. Right?</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: Uh-uh.</p>

<p><em>Salesman</em>: But in logic &lsquo;<em>p</em> only if <em>q</em>&rsquo; is just a variant of &lsquo;if <em>p</em> then <em>q</em>&rsquo;; so &lsquo;if <em>p</em>, then <em>p</em> only if <em>q</em>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;if <em>p</em>, then if <em>p</em> then <em>q</em>&rsquo; &ndash; and that&rsquo;s equivalent to &lsquo;if <em>p</em>, then <em>q</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: What on earth has that got to do with my buying the car?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>A couple of comments are worth making here.  (1) Beware of car salesmen who start spouting off dubious claims about logical equivalence. They&rsquo;re up to something fishy.   (2) What on earth is the qualifier &lsquo;in logic&rsquo; doing in the salesman&rsquo;s claim? Can&rsquo;t the customer reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;<em>in logic</em>&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m in a car yard trying to get out of my apparent commitment to buy this car&rdquo;?  Surely it should be &lsquo;in our study of logic, we&rsquo;ve figured out that &hellip;&rsquo; not some claim about what&rsquo;s true &lsquo;in logic&rsquo; as that makes us wonder about if it&rsquo;s true elsewhere.   (3) The claim that &lsquo;<em>p</em> only if <em>q</em>&rsquo; and is <em>equivalent</em> to &lsquo;if <em>p</em> then <em>q</em>&rsquo; is highly dubious in general, but here we don&rsquo;t need to consider he niceties of the semantics and pragmatics of conditionals.  We just simply need to note that both &lsquo;<em>p</em> only if <em>q</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;if <em>p</em> then <em>q</em>&rsquo; entail the much weaker claim that <em>p</em> materially implies <em>q</em> (that either <em>q</em> is true or <em>p</em> isn&rsquo;t) and read all other instances of &lsquo;if &hellip; then&rsquo; in the dialogue as material conditionals. (4) The inference principle appealed to by the salesman is the inference of <em>contraction</em> (from <em>p</em> &rarr; (<em>p</em> &rarr; <em>q</em>) to <em>p</em> &rarr; <em>q</em>).  Perhaps if the customer had read <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics/">my thesis</a> he or she might have had a chance at resisting the slide at this point.  But I doubt it.  (5) <em>This is a completely irrelevant aside</em>. An exercise to the reader: Discuss whether or not it is, in fact, possible that a fictional character in a dialogue written in 1976 to read a Ph.D. thesis written nearly twenty years later.</p>

<p>On with the dialogue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: You said that if you&rsquo;ll buy the car, then you&rsquo;ll buy the car only if I&rsquo;ll guarantee it.  But that, you see, is logically equivalent to saying that if you&rsquo;ll buy the car then I&rsquo;ll guarantee it.</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: Never mind what is logically equivalent to what!  Will you guarantee the car?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good objection.  Keep track of whether or not the salesman <em>ever</em> addresses this point that the customer has made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: I&rsquo;m not saying anything about that just now.  You said &ndash; remember? &ndash; that I can hold you to what you&rsquo;ve said.  And you&rsquo;ve as good as said that if you&rsquo;ll buy the car then I&rsquo;ll guarantee it.</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: Well, yes, it looks as if I did say that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, I am reminded of many Socratic dialogues, in which a hapless victim says &ldquo;Well, yes, Socrates, it does appear that you&rsquo;re right&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: But you also said that, on condition that if you&rsquo;ll but the car, I&rsquo;ll guarantee it, you undertake you&rsquo;ll buy the car.</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: Yes I did.</p>

<p><em>Salesman</em>: But you are logically committed, as we just saw, to saying that the condition you stipulated is fulfilled: namely, that if you&rsquo;ll buy the car then I&rsquo;ll guarantee it.</p>

<p><em>Customer</em>: &ndash; * &ndash; ? * ! *</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the customer says at this point, but it does seem to be not particularly polite.  If I were the customer, I wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking polite thoughts, either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: So you&rsquo;ve just got to buy the car, guarantee or no guarantee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, either a sign of remarkable ignorance on the part of the salesman, or disingenuousness.  I leave it to you to decide which is the likelier explanation on the basis of the dialogue thus far.</p>

<p>But look at the customer&rsquo;s next step!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Customer</em>: But I said that I&rsquo;ll buy the car only if you&rsquo;ll guarantee it.  So if I am going to buy the car &ndash; as you pretend to have proved that I must &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got to guarantee it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aha!  Good point.  Now, will the salesman address the issue of the guarantee?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Salesman</em>: I don&rsquo;t have to accept that.  You said I could hold you to what you said: that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been doing.  I&rsquo;m not bound by what you said, obviously.  So it&rsquo;s a deal.  I see you have your Access card there, sir.  Thankyou very much, Sir. Please sign here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what do you think?  Is the salesman as disingenuous as I have made out?  <em>Should</em> the salesman have inferred that he will guarantee the car?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to find a way to make that plausible.  As shifty as the saleseman appears, it does seem that he&rsquo;s right.  He&rsquo;s helping the customer  see the consequences of what she/he has said.  Nothing he says commits *him*self to those claims.</p>

<p>However, it does seem to me that if the customer is still committed to the promise, then she/he is still committed to concluding that the salesman will guarantee the car.  In the face of manifest evidence that the salesman will <em>not</em> guarantee the car, then isn&rsquo;t the appropriate thing to conclude that it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> the case that the customer will buy the car if and only if he/she will buy the car only if there&rsquo;s a guarantee?  That is, shouldn&rsquo;t the customer take back the claim, or the conditional <em>promise</em> to buy the car.</p>

<p>Is this actually breaking a commitment?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, since the commitment has a factual consequence.  (If the commitment is <em>met</em> then the guarantee is made).  It&rsquo;s as if I promise to bring wash up after you cook dinner tonight.  If you decide <em>not</em> to cook dinner tonight, then there&rsquo;s nothing I can do to wash up after you cook dinner.    It was a silly promise to make, as meeting is beyond my control. Circumstances can conspire to make it <em>impossible</em> (in those circumstances) for me to meet the promise.  Similarly in the salesman case.  If the customer is committed to seeing to it that he/she purchases the car if and only if, he/she purchases the car only if it is guaranteed, then a consequent commitment is to see to it that the guarantee is made.  If that&rsquo;s outside the control of the customer, the commitment cannot be met.</p>

<p>So, I reckon, the customer shouldn&rsquo;t sign!  Don&rsquo;t buy the car.  An especially, don&rsquo;t trust car salesmen who appear to know a lot of logic.</p>

<p>Thanks to Su Rogerson for telling me about this wonderful dialogue.</p>
