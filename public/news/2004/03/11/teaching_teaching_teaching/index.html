<p>Teaching for 2004 Semester 1 is now well underway.  My classes for this term have been enjoyable in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Non-Classical Logic</em> is a second/third level logic class.  I've decided to follow Graham Priest's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/052179434X/nosim/consequentlyorg">An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic</a> rather closely, which means I don't need to make too many further decisions.  (It's designed to fit into an Australian academic semester, and to follow an intro logic course just like <a href="http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/">mine</a>.)  The book doesn't take <em>quite</em> the line I'd follow, but it's much better than a merely "good enough" book that I'd use through gritted teeth. My differences with Graham's view of things are two.  <ol> 
<li style="margin-top:5px;"> Graham structures the course around the search for a good semantics for the conditional of natural language.  I think that <em>that</em> question is both easier (for many purposes -- think of mathematical reasoning -- the "material conditional" is just fine and dandy, thankyou very much) and more difficult (there's all sorts of context sensitivity in conditional constructions which a sensible look at would take you very very far away from a second-level undergraduate course) than Graham concedes, so I don't get as much out of the central theme as Graham does.</li>   
<li> I think that there is more mileage you can get out of the idea of a <em>normal modal logic</em> than Graham manages to express in his Chapter 3.  The ideas of modal logic are just <em>so</em> fruitful and <em>so</em> beautiful, that I can't speed over them in just one chapter.  Think <em>temporal</em> logic, <em>deontic</em> logic, <em>dynamic</em> logic,  etc., etc&nbsp;...  Here, the formal stuff is just so beautiful that I need to do more than Graham does with this material.  This is, as far as I can tell, a matter of <em>taste</em>, and this is one place that my taste differs from Graham's, and it shows.  There is more to be said for the role of the teacher as a cultivator of taste, but I must leave that for another time.</li>
</ol>
Teaching this class is enjoyable because I know the material like the back of my hand, the students are (mostly) keen to learn, and it's a healthy mix of teaching different kinds of constructions, proving theorems, and doing philosophy.</li>
<li> My <em>other</em> major responsibility is my fourth-year honours seminar entitled <em>Logic &amp; Philosophy</em>.  This year we're going through some of Robert Brandom's greatest hits, starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674001583/nosim/consequentlyorg"><em>Articulating Reasons</em></a>, glancing aside to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674543300/nosim/consequentlyorg"><em>Making it Explicit</em></a> where necessary (the running joke is that <em>Articulating Reasons</em> should be subtitled "Making <em>Making it Explicit</em> Explicit") and then on to some of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674009037/nosim/consequentlyorg"><em>Tales of the Mighty Dead</em></a>.  This is a "big picture" philosophy course, taking in history, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, normative theory, philosophy of logic, and the kitchen sink.  I'm uneasy with anticipation when I wonder what the students (and here I have a smaller group of about twelve) will make of it all.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of <em>those</em> teaching responsibilities, I have a small honours reading course in modal logic that I'm taking with <a href="http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#allen">Allen Hazen</a>, a new honours student to supervise, a couple of continuing Ph.D. students, and two and a half <em>new</em> Ph.D. students, all working on interesting projects.  I have to keep up with inferentialism and Kant's theory of judgement, non-standard probability theory, ontology, Carnap &amp; van Fraassen &amp; <em>stances</em>, and the distinction between pure and depraved <em>semantics</em>.  This, in case you were wondering, is why I'm sometimes just a little behind on other things.
