I'm back from the Women's Team Epee quarter- and semi-finals: Russia and Switzerland are off into the Gold medal round tonight, and Hungary play China.  I think the Chinese were the surprise package -- they whipped France, and the French looked rather shocked about it.  Similarly, the Russians beat the Germans, and then rounded it off with a 46-45 win over the Hungarians (who were going in as the favourites).  It was a great way to be introduced to fencing, with <a href="/images/FencingFour.jpg">four bouts going on at once</a> at the start, and then two at a time to decide the ranking of those placed 5 to 8, and to decide the Bronze and Gold matches.

     That's <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13069.html"><em>very</em> sneaky</a>.   It might be sensible for Amazon to offer discounts to first-time buyers, but do you think it's sensible to offer discounts for new buyers without letting them, or the regular buyers know about it?  
<p>
According to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13069.html">the article</a> the discount only applies to DVDs at present, though there's no assurance what crazy pricing mechanisms they'll be able to apply whenever they want.  Think about it: the store is a big computer program.  It's easy to change prices and to let prices be a function of <em>any</em> data you've got on each individual buyer.  It's much easier than relabelling stock in an honest-to-goodness <em>shop</em>.  I think we can expect to see more variable pricing schemes in future as e-businesses attempt to eke out as much revenue as they can on their bare margins.

<p>
Actually, I'd like to think that we could <em>see</em> it happen in the future, but the problem is, it's really hard to see it in action.  The way Amazon implements the scheme, it's almost invisible.  I see the prices I see when I browse.  I don't see the prices <em>you</em> see when you browse.  However, it's not impossible to sidestep the scheme.
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13069.html">There's a way</a> to fool Amazon into treating you as a first-time buyer too.    Just trash your cookies and restart your internet connection, or visit Amazon from a machine which hasn't been used to visit Amazon before.  (Just don't log in with your old log-in information, or it will recognise you as a previous buyer.)  
<p>
I called this process "fooling" Amazon, but on reflection, I don't think that doing this this is <em>fooling</em> them at all.  If they haven't told us that this is a discount for first-time buyers, then we have no assurance from them that this is not a discount for buyers-from-computers-of-which-they-have-no-records-of-on-their-computers.  (After all, that's what the software detects.  It doesn't detect whether or not I've bought from them before.) And <em>that</em> discount is something we can all enjoy.

     Dani <a href="http://www.web-therapy.com/2000_09_03_archives.html">asks</a> (and I quote)
<blockquote>
Can one who claims that this world began from and in chaos (ie. without any order, purpose or design) apply logic and reason to his/her discussions about it?
</blockquote>
The answer is, of course, <em>yes</em>.  A person who claims that the world has no order, purpose or design can of course reason as logically as anyone else.  They can do whatever everyone else does, I suppose.
<p>
There is a question of whether they can use reasoning 
<em>justifiably</em>.  Is their commitment to good reasoning, as displayed in their doing it, inconsistent with their commitment to a chaotic unordered world? I suppose
that's the question Dani is asking.
<p>
Before I go on to answer it, I should complain just gently about the running together of "without order", "without purpose" and "without design".  I think these things can all come apart.  Something can have order but no design (raindrops fall in an order, but aren't designed to -- or at least it seems <em>possible</em> that they aren't designed) something can have design without purpose (in any ordinary sense of "purpose" -- think of purposeless pieces of art) and many people think that things can have purpose without design (many think that biological systems are like this -- a heart can be <em>for</em> pumping blood even if no-one intended it for that).  None of these examples are uncontentious of course, but it begs way too many questions to assume that the three terms stand or fall together.  But, back to the question at hand: can a person who believes that the world is orderless, purposeless and designless still be committed to logical reasoning?
<p>
The answer I prefer for this question is the generous one.  <em>Of course</em> a person who believes that the world has no order, purpose 
or design can reason logically.  Why think that the application of reason only works in an ordered, or purposeful or designed system?  We can reason reasonably about chaos, just as well as order.  Take the person who is <em>agnostic</em> about the purpose or the design or the order in a situation -- they can still reason about it regardless.  Logic is the story about what follows from what in <em>all</em> situations.  It's true of <em>every</em> situation (both the designed, ordered and purposeful ones, and those that are not) that
both premises:
<ul>
<li>Greg is a lecturer, 
<li>If Greg is a lecturer, he enjoys his job.
</ul>
are true, then so is the conclusion
<ul>
<li>Greg enjoys his job.
</ul>
is true too.  That's independent of any order, purpose or design, as far as I can tell.  It's just the inference of <em>modus ponens</em>, and many people think that it tells us more about how "if ... then ..." works than it does tell us about how the world works. 
<p>
Now, it's open to you to say that if a situation satisfies <em>modus ponens</em> and other kinds of logical inferences, then there's order there and then.  But that's way too cheap.  If you want to call that <em>order</em> then more power too you.  But don't you dare attempt to infer from this that there's design or purpose or any of those more robust features.  Had the world been uncreated or had it all been a purposeless cosmic accident then <em>modus ponens</em> would still work.   That's <em>logic</em>!
<p>
There.  That got that off my chest.  Let none of this lead you to infer anything about my opinions on whether the world as a whole is designed or ordered or created.  I don't think that a commitment to logic alone is going to get you to that conclusion.  <em>Other</em> things may well do that.  Of those other things, perhaps more will be said later.
<p>
(This little rant can be seen as an appendix to my earlier <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/misc/faithandlogic.html">thoughts on logic and faith</a>.  Perhaps I will merge them one day.  <a href="mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au">comments</a>, of course, are always welcome.)

I don't know what to make of our Police Commissioner, according to <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A409-2000Sep1.html">this quote</a>:

"We expect Sydney to be a very safe city," said Peter Ryan, the police commissioner for the state of New South Wales, who is in charge of security for the Games. "<em>We have literally planned for every possible contingency</em>."
</blockquote>
Now, I don't know a lot about contingency planning, but I do know that there are a <em>lot</em> more possible scenarios than one can plan for in just a few years.

     I suppose I ought to say something about <a href="http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0009/hypo.html">this little Lingua Franca note</a> about model theory.  I am a model theorist, among other things, so I should say something about the appropriation of my discipline by certain philosophers.  Trouble is: I don't have a settled opinion about the "model theoretic argument" reported in the <a href="http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0009/hypo.html">article</a>.  
<p>
Oh well.  They're tricky, interesting ideas, anyway.

     Life ticks on.  Today, inbetween all of the other stuff, I'm thinking about relationships between proof theories.  In particular, delabelling labelled proof theories.  That probably doesn't mean much to you.  The problem is, it doesn't mean too much to me yet either.  I know what I want to do, but I don't know how to articulate it.  This job fits in nicely with all the other non-intellectual tidying up I need to do.

TeX has the amazing feature that it can accurately capture the structure of the document, yet render completely consistently on all platforms, allowing great artistic control over layout. The relative popularity of HTML over TeX is of course evidence that the world is unfair.
