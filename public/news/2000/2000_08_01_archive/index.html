     I have a sordid confession to make.  I indulge in middle-brow science fiction.  My first love in science fiction is the more creative and wild material, like <a href="http://world.std.com/~mmcirvin/vitrifax.html">Stanislaw Lem</a> and the socialist political novels of <a href="http://www.phlebas.com/">Ian M. Banks</a> and
<a href="http://sflare.com/fiction/macleod.html">Ken MacLeod</a>.  However, occassionally I have been known to descend into the more mainstream material, such as Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy.  One author of a similar quality is the Canadian, <a href="http://www.sfwriter.com/">Robert J. Sawyer</a>.  My guilty secret to reveal is that I have spent a couple of hours in a bookshop in the middle of Calgary, reading (and not paying for!) his <a href="http://www.sfwriter.com/exfh.htm">Factoring Humanity</a>.  I had an excuse.  I was wanting a lazy afternoon, I had just explored the museum, and it was pouring with rain.  The bookshop had comfortable seats, and I sat and read an agreeable tale.
<p>
Now I find that he's written a new book  <a href="http://www.sfwriter.com/excg.htm">Calculating God</a>, with the intruiging premise that aliens come to earth, looking for proof of divine creation.  O for another rainy day in which to waste some more time.

     You're writing a paper.  Or rather, you're <em>attempting</em> to write a paper, and you're getting bogged down.   It's not going anywhere, and you're in need of some help.  You search your computer for references to <em>Carnap</em> and you discover a draft of a paper you wrote in 1995, with a full four pages of interesting, unpublished and useable material on the topic you're working on now.  The feeling?  Relief.  And gratitude to your past self.

     <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/sportsf/stories/s140894.htm">John Clarke</a>: Yes, well farnarkling's a very good example, where I was actually doing a television series on which I did something about sport each week, and that was OK in Australia when we were in the summer, but it got to be a problem when we were in the winter, because there was a different code in a lot of the different places to which the program went. So I decided to standardise it by the invention of a completely different sort of sport, no less bogus than any of the other ones, (have a look at the Colonial Stadium) but full of its own things, it's own terminology and its own kind of heroes, many unsung, and a hero has to be unsung to a certain extent, sung heroes are you know, Shane Warne and so on, you're in trouble there. So yes, and I really did enjoy doing it. And I grew up in New Zealand of course, where Rugby is a religious matter, and these people were regarded as being geniuses, people who frankly weren't geniuses, but were wearing the right clothing. It's all a bit silly.

     There's been lots of talk in the media about how silly it is that the Russians aren't accepting outside help in rescuing their submariners.

He's a great example of someone exploring a particular religious tradition (in his case, Buddhism) and working within interesting areas of analytic philosophy.  His paper "<a href="http://www.smith.edu/philosophy/faculty/jgarfield/papers/recently_published/ta_dhd_final.htm">Temporality and Alterity</a>" addresses some of these issues.   The quote which leads the article: "If Western philosophers don't think that philosophy can lead to liberation from cyclic existence, why do they do it?"  Great stuff.

     I've spent a few hours browsing the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/">ScienceDirect</a> archive of academic journals.  It's getting <em>way</em> easier to use these net-hosted archives of academic publications: download times are dropping as we get faster net access, and nicer computers mean that the rendering of pdf or postscript files is much more bearable.  However, the user interface still stinks compared with browsing through a library.  There, I can just pick up a journal and flick through the pages.  It will be a while before net-based publications can match this ease of assimilating vast swathes of information quickly.

     Well, meetings are a strange sort of thing.  I've spent all morning in a departmental meeting.  We didn't actually decide much.  It was one of those meetings where you seem to spend most of the time deciding what it is that you need to decide, and what doesn't need decisions.  The actual <em>decisions</em> seem to come later.  At least I seem to have a pretty good grip on what's happening in my own department, as nothing blindsided me.  (I think it's taken me a couple of years to actually get to this point.)

     <b>Newsflash</b>: I'm really enjoying teaching.  There's a crazy buzz involved when you're addressing a bunch of students.  Of around 450 or so students in a large theatre, and by-and-large, they look and sound like they're listening and interested, and sometimes, they even laugh at your jokes!  Teaching is a Good Thing.

     The latest policy announcement on <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/media/0800/kbmlmsrf020800.html">research fellowships</a> from the <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/">Australian Labor Party</a> is a <em>Good Thing</em>.  I say that, not just because I suppose I'm in the target market for research fellowships, but also because I care about the higher education system here in Australia.  However, boosting funding for research fellowships is not going to stop the brain drain in and of itself.  What makes overseas so attractive to me, is the <a href="/news/2000/2000_07_01_archive/#538622">general state of the universities here</a>.  Merely having an elite class of researchers on cozy fellowships is not enough.  How attractive do you think it would be to be a well-funded researcher in a department which is struggling to make ends meet, and attempting to cope with inflated student numbers and staff numbers?

Increased funding for research will only pay off in the context of a healthy university environment.  This includes teaching as well as research.

     Should I be worried or delighted that a search for <a href="http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=Cosmetic%20Surgical%20arts&amp;b=20&amp;hc=1&amp;hs=1">cosmetic surgical arts</a> appeared in my referrer logs?

     Let me say something about <em>rights</em>.  I'm <em>not</em> going to address <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/2000_07_01_archive/#555555">Russ'</a> issue of rights to free speech (I think I have nothing clarifying to say about that issue).  What's exercising me at present is the news that our federal government is going to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0008/02/pageone/pageone1.html">amend the Sex Discrimination Act to prevent its use against state laws which attempt to limit fertility treatment for people outside of heterosexual relationships.</a>  I don't want to focus on the subsantive issue at the moment.  What interested me this morning was hearing the rhetoric the Prime Minister used to defend his decision.  <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0008/02/pageone/pageone1.html">He said that</a> <em>a child's right to a mother and a father is paramount.</em>
<p>
Now, I can understand him saying that it is <em>good</em> for a child to grow up in a stable home, even a stable two-parent heterosexual relationship home.  Goodness, I can even understand him saying that it's best for a child to grow up in a family constituted of a husband and a wife who got married in a church and live in a nice two-bedroom house with a picket fence! (I have nothing against church marriages, having had one myself, and I have nothing in particular against picket fences, though I don't have one of them.)  What I can't understand is him saying that this is a matter of <em>rights</em>.  That has to be wrong.

<p>
Why does a child not have a <em>right</em> to grow up in a family with a mother and a father?  It's simple: a right always brings with it a corresponding obligation or duty.  If I have a right to <em>x</em>, I have a duty to not take <em>x</em> away from you.  If I have a right to free speech, you have a duty to not prevent me from speaking.  If I have a right to food, you have a duty to not take all of the food away from me.  
<p>
Now, how does this work in the case of parenting?  Did my parents have a <em>duty</em> to not separate, <em>because of me and my brother</em> when I was a child?  I don't think so.  I agree that had my parent's had a functioning relationship it would have been in my interests for them to stay together.  But I don't see that as a matter of my rights.  If I had rights as a child, they were rights to be cared for and looked after, and my mother did that very very well.  My rights were respected, even though my parents split up.  Let's take a more stark example.  Does a mother who's partner dies before childbirth have a <em>duty</em> to get another partner before the baby is born?  Surely she should if the baby has a <em>right</em> to two parents.  No, it's sad that the baby will not be raised by both parents, but no-one would want to say that she <em>must</em> find another partner to father the baby.
<p>
No, this rights talk is all a furphy.  I agree: Children have a right to be cared for.  I don't see how this means that they have a <em>right</em> to two parents.
<p>
Why does the Government talk of rights in this context?  It's simple.  If the P.M. simply said "we think it's <em>good</em> for children to have two parents" and directed its legislation accordingly, then the government would be seen as engaging in the kind of social engineering they take belong to the other side of politics.  And we can't have that.
<p>
<span class="sml">I know that the way I've put this is contentious.  Do you agree with me?  Or disagree?  If you've got somthing 
to say, post it at the <a href="http://www.greenspun.com/com/_classify_input/grestall/log/">Comments page</a>.</span>

     Similarity Strangeness at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.  What do you make of this?

(I can think of a couple of reasons why this result might surface.  I wonder what the real reason is.)
