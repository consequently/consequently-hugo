     There's a <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/detail.cfm?link_ID=1868">helpful discussion</a> over at <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">Metafilter</a> on answering email.  The question at issue is: <em>What's a reasonable amount of time, for you, to expect someone to reply to an email?</em>  Good question.  It really depends on the person, I think.  But knowing what <em>other</em> people's expectations are helps me know how to treat the emails I get.
<p>
But remember: it's a person at the other end.  It's a <em>Good Thing</em> to treat people with respect.  (This is why I feel so bad when I'm such a <em>Bad</em> email correspondent sometimes.  The emails languishing in my <em>To Do</em> boxes burn a hole in my conscience too.)

     Found on <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">Metafilter</a>: <a href="http://www.carfree.com/">Carfree</a> is a manifesto for cities without cars.  I like this, as I'm a fan of public transport and minimising car usage.  The site has more information on how to construct a car-free city from scratch than on how to help transform your city into one which depends less on cars.

Alas, our <a href="http://www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au/">rail network</a> is in crisis, and the <a href="http://www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au/">Olympics</a> will not make things any easier.

     I'm noticing people coming in to this log searching for <em>Crimenet</em>.  This is because of my earlier two posts (<a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#196349">here</a> and <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#212585">here</a>). 
<p>I heard on the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/">radio</a> yesterday that <a href="http://www.crimenet.com.au/">Crimenet</a> is changing its access policy to make things more restrictive.  So, I go and I look at the site and find no change to the policies yet.  On the contrary, the search for criminal academics and I find two new things:  
<p>
<em>First</em>, the search is zippy.  They've thrown more server power at it.  It's actually useable now.  
<p>
<em>Second</em>, now there are only <em>three</em> criminal academics as opposed to the <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#212585">four</a> I found last time.  (But there's <em>no</em> information about why suspect number four dropped out of the database.  Another thing to increase the suspicion.)
<p>
Oh, and one more thing.  Why is the <em>Unabomber</em> (Ted Kaczynski) one of the three people they record as an academic with a criminal record?  Were any of his crimes committed under Australian jurisdiction?
Not necessarily.  If you read the fine print  on Crimenet's <a href="http://www.crimenet.com.au/cgi-bin/cnet/allegro.pl?serve20000429191837.about.html">about page</a>, you find that:
<blockquote>
We have a team of dedicated staff gathering information on crime, criminals, con artists and tricksters from around Australia and around the world. 
</blockquote>
So now I get to not only know the names of who I should be possibly worried about, but I also have no idea of whether they're in Australia or not?
<p>
If I were of a suspicious mind, I would think that they've had to pad their database with as many entries as they can, whether relevant and in their remit or not.

I find this sort of corporatisation of military "services" scary.  Not that it's a new thing.  And not that governments use military force in particularly ethical ways.

To come to think of it: <em>why</em> do I find this scary?  I think I'll need to worry about this some more if I'm to come to a considered view.

But then, if <em>this</em> blog entry gets up, it isn't hosed, and the paper should be there very soon after this is posted.  Hmmm...
<p>
I'm glad it got done, anyway.

     I finally managed to complete my Crimenet search for academics with criminal records I mentioned <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#196349">last week</a>. (To recap: Crimenet is a commercially maintained database of criminal activity in Australia.  I was searching for academics with criminal records.)  I was presented with a screen featuring three names: three names from the database marked as academics and people with criminal records.  I would have had to pay a small fee to see the Crimenet files for these three individuals to see what the database records these individuals as having actually <em>done</em>.  All I was presented with was three unannotated names.  I declined forking over my cash to see the details.
<p>
After seeing it (I didn't recognise any of the individuals) I became convinced that this way of presenting the information is altogether reprehensible.  I get for free an uninformed suspicion about named individuals.  I have to <em>pay</em> to get this suspcion informed and clarified. For all I know, these charges could be <em>anything</em>, and most possibilities are completely harmless.  Yet, knowing what I know, I cannot be sure.  Paranoia comes for free.  
<p>
This is no surprise, because creating a paranoid public is very much in the company's interest.

Yesterday, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">package</a> arrived at last.  (One advantage of being antipodeal is that when you order from a large <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">ecommerce</a> firm and pay for surface delivery {because air delivery is rather expensive} then you have time for <em>forget</em> what you ordered by the time it arrives.  It's like a present from your former self.)  Anyway, yesterday's package was a present consisting of <a href="http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1575861933/">two</a> <a href="http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/0674001877/">books</a>.

<p>
The <em>first,</em> <a href="http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1575861933/">Situations and Attitudes</a>, I have already read.  It's the groundbreaking work by <a href="http://www-vil.cs.indiana.edu/barwise.html">Barwise</a> and <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/">Perry</a>.  It proposes a new (well, it was new in the 1980's) semantic theory which takes situations and context as crucial, especially in the treatment of attitude reports, like belief and knowledge reports, and reports of perception.  The reprint is cheap, and good for my bookshelf.  

<p>
The <em>second</em> is the thousand page tome <a href="http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/0674001877/">The Sociology of Philosophies</a>.  To quote the blurb
<blockquote>
Through network diagrams and sustained narrative, sociologist Randall Collins traces the development of philosophical thought from ancient Greece to modern Europe. Collins provides a self-reflexive sociological philosophy of intellectual life that opens a new path beyond relativism and realism.
</blockquote>
Well, I don't know if the right sort of contrast is between relativism and realism, but then, sociologists usually mean different things by these terms.  What I want the book for is its encyclopedic sweep of philosophical history, and his analysis of how philosophical schools grow, develop, clash and die out.  The <em>data</em> in the book is amazing, and there's lots of food for thought for me; because I'm trying to understand the context I work in.
<p>
Context, context, context.

     Erasmus is busy getting herself tangled in a ball of wool as I write this.  She's done this before, and she's much better at untangling herself from it than I am at untangling the modem cord.  Perhaps I can employ her as a professional cord untangler.  There's one catch: she perfers playing to her own time over working to mine.  She's very cute with it, of course.

     A <a href="http://www.mcs.net/%7Erusaerog/boosters/buran.html">Buran</a>, a Russian Space Shuttle test vehicle has <a href="http://www.suburbia.com.au/~colinc/buran/buran2.jpg">come to Sydney</a>.   It will be on display at the old harbour casino site for at least two years from Mid-June, according to my <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/">newspaper</a>. More of the story can be found in <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-021000a.html">this article</a>, which includes this surprising tidbit:
<blockquote>Then, in 1998, the Buran 002 was offered for sale through websites such as www.spacehardware.com. Listed at $10 million, the shuttle was also posted at least once to the popular online auction site eBay, though no serious offers were received.</blockquote>
More photographs can be found <a href="http://www.suburbia.com.au/~colinc/buran/buran.htm">here</a> and more information about Buran and its place in the former Soviet space industry is <a href="http://www.friends-partners.org/~mwade/craft/buran.htm">here</a>. <p>
The <a href="http://www.buran.com.au/">Buran company website</a>, from the Australians who bought the thing and will be showing it, seems to have a number of shortcomings.  First, there's precious little content there, especially in the HTML version (don't get me started about the ridiculous shockwave animations).  Second, it's all in that kitsch retro Soviet art style, which is to be expected, but shows little imagination.  Third, the navigation window doesn't give you much of an idea of what the content is where (what <em>precisely</em> is the difference between the control tower, the communication room and the launch pad? ).  Finally, the server doesn't seem to be particularly able to handle the load since the news broke some days ago.

alt="[night on earth]" width="162" height="236" border="1" align="right" hspace="5"></a><a href="http://www.crimenet.com.au/">Crimenet</a>
is the world's first site to provide a complete information service on criminal records, stolen property, missing persons, wanted persons, con artists and unsolved crimes.
<p>
There's been lots of discussion about this site here in Australia in the last week, since its opening.  The database behind the website is a collection of freely available information: court records, information about scams from the media (all checked for 
accuracy, according to the owners) and police informion about unsolved crimes.  The information is all there in an easy to access form, some of it free, and some of it available for a small fee.  You can access the criminal database and search for data on past crimes by all manner of relevant properties.  (Location, Kind of Crime, or Name.  Most odd, however is the search by `occupation':  you can search for crimse committed by Bank Managers, Sportspeople, or Media Personalities, and even <em>Academics</em>.)  It is a reasonably comprehensive database of crimes committed in Australia.</p>
<p>
Now why do people have a problem with this?  The information is all there on the public record anyway.  Why should people be concerned about this database?</p>
<p>
The answer should be clear.  The information is publically available, for sure, but in nothing like this form.  We make phone directories publically available, but we don't like it when people sell databases of phone numbers linked to addresses.  It's all too easy to abuse this by searching for phone numbers attached to addresses, and to use this to do <em>bad things</em>: such as phoning down a street to see who's away from home to see which are the good places to break and enter.  All this is well enough known.  The mere fact that the information is publically available doesn't entail that it is permissible to make it available
in any form.  If people can track your criminal record with such ease, this will change your life in a way like nothing before.</p>
<p>
The problem for us in the future is that information will become more and more manipulable in these ways.  We will be confronted by new ways to use the information already available to us, and this will change the world we live in.</p?
><p>
Of course, this database is <em>so</em> popular that I've never 
been able to access it successfully, and so I don't yet know which other academics I should be worrying about.

     Do you ever wonder <em>what</em> they're doing with their phones or PDAs in that <a href="http://www.contextmag.com/setFrameRedirect.asp?src=/archives/200004/Impact.asp">meeting (or class)</a>?  It changes the face of people getting together, at least in large groups.

     I don't do <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/">this</a> to belong to the "blogging community", but nonetheless, I've asked to be included in <a href="http://www.jjoeclark.uni.cc/">Joe Clark's</a> list of <a href="http://www.electricseed.com/joeclark/xenoblogs.html">Xenoblogs</a>.  That's a nice list of non-US views on the web and the world.  Notice the inordinately high concentrations in Canada and the Netherlands.

     Well, yesterday I got a reasonable amount of work done.  Most fun was sending off copies of my <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/">book</a> to some colleagues and teachers who helped me in various ways during its preparation.  I hope they like it!
<p>
Also fun was updating my computers (the office <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a> and the home <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBook</a>) to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macos/">MacOS 9</a>.  I spent too long playing with <a href="http://www.apple.com/speech/">speakable items</a>.  It's fun, for a short while, to get your computer to check your email by telling it to "check my mail" but then it feels rather stupid.

     Check the <a href="http://www.shift.com/shiftstd/html/onlineTOC/2000/8.2/html/Gates1.html">Bill Gates Makeover</a>.  I found this courtesy of <a href="http://www.bryanboyer.com/">Bryan Boyer's</a> insightful <a href="http://www.bryanboyer.com/today.html?c=daily/050100.data">essay</a> on what we think of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, and the function of style in this (what I seem to like to call, without much justification) late capitalist society.
<p>
Why no justification in calling this late capitalism?  Simply because we might well not be near the end of it.  Perish the thought.

     Well, <a href="http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html">JC</a> tells me that some people can't get into the OED <a href="http://www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd">Word of the Day</a>

I don't think that includes much web surfing, so updates here will be slow to nonexistent.

To keep you occupied, how about you try the <a href="http://www.oed.com/">OED</a>'s <A href="http://www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd">Word of the Day</A>.  (Today's seems to be "dictionary".  Hmmm.)
