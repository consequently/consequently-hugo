     You might have to be Australian to understand <a href="http://www.chaser.com.au/archive/news/news11/democrats_hoax.htm">this story</a>
from the Chaser.  A quote:
<blockquote>
We were pretty bitter at first - it takes a lot of effort to develop a Democrat puppet from scratch, but we just had to move on. I don't know who is operating Cheryl now, but when I see the footage on TV, I can't say that her movements and demeanour look terribly realistic.
</blockquote>
The backstory: The <a href="http://www.democrats.org.au/">Democrats</a> are a minor party in Australia's political life, positioned somewhere between the <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/">Labor party</a> on the one hand and the <a href="http://www.nsw.liberal.org.au/">conservative</a> <a href="http://www.npa.org.au/">parties</a> on the other.  <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/member.asp?id=XW4">Cheryl Kernot</a> defected from the Democrats to the Labor party in 1997, but sunk from sight in the midst of media scrutiny, pressure and much speculation about her leadership ability and prospects in the faction-ridden Labor party.  She has never been the same.

     Hermann Weyl was wise.  He wrote:
<blockquote>
We are not very pleased when we are forced to accept a mathematical truth by virtue of a complicated chain of formal conclusions and computations, which we traverse blindly, link by link, feeling our way by touch.  We want first an overview of the aim and of the road; we want to understand the <em>idea</em> of the proof, the deeper context.<p><em>Unterrichtsblätter für Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften</em>, 38, 177-188 (1932). Translation by Abe Shenitzer appeared in <em>The American Mathematical Monthly</em>, v. 102, no. 7 (August-September 1995), p. 646.

As someone with a mathematical education, I agree with the sentiment, but I find the way of expressing it very curious.  I would have thought that all finite numbers were <em>significantly</em> closer to zero than to infinity.  Infinity is very, <em>very</em> big.  But then, I think, this thought expresses how we think about numbers.  Most of the ones we think about are small, and easily distinguished.    All the rest are "close togther" up there in the sky where the big numbers live (or wherever they are), and not too distinct. What's the difference between 100 billion and 1000 billion anyway?   

<p>Anyway, Lovins et. al.'s <a href="http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/0316353167/">Natural Capitalism</a> sounds worthwhile: if we're going to measure things economically, we should at least do it realistically.

     A nice definition of the scientific method from <a href="http://www.moonboy.com/sms/index.htm">Science Made Stupid</a>:
<p>
The cornerstone of modern science is the <em>scientific method</em>. Scientists first 
formulate <em>hypotheses</em>, or predictions, about nature. Then they perform 
<em>experiments</em> to test their hypotheses. There are two forms of scientific 
method, the <em>inductive</em> and the <em>deductive</em>.
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td valign="top"  class="sml">
<ul><b>INDUCTIVE</b><p>
<li>formulate hypothesis
<li>apply for grant
<li>perform experiments or gather data to test hypothesis
<li>alter data to fit hypothesis
<li>publish
</ul>
</td><td valign="top"  class="sml">
<ul><b>DEDUCTIVE</b><p>

<li>apply for grant
<li>perform experiments or gather data to test hypothesis
<li>revise hypothesis to fit data

     Played around this afternoon with Barwise and Etchemendy and Co.'s <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/LPL/">Language, Proof and Logic</a> software.  They've done a good job of writing software to help students do elementary logic, but it is <em>still</em> tedious to use.  So much clicking, typing, selecting, mousing around and generally moving your focus from the proof to the goals, to the button bar to the menu bar.  It is completely unnatural, compared to writing on a piece of paper (or a whiteboard for that matter).  There is so much more <em>bandwidth</em> in the human/pen/paper interaction which there isn't in the human/(keyboard and mouse)/screen combination.  

<p>
Now that I think of it, this is one reason why using a Newton, despite its itty-bitty screen, is actually a liberating computing experience.  The jumping around the screen with a pen is much quicker than mousing/clicking/typing.
