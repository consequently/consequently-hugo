     If I thought <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~tbonepage/">T-Bone Burnett</a> sounded good on those speakers, I had no idea what they could do with the <a href="http://www.universalclassics.com/usa/selection.asp?selection_id=2230">Isle of the Dead</a>.  Of course, the massive thunderstorm, combined with the alarms going off all over campus and the faint sounds of sirens in the distance could have had something to do with the general tenor of the afternoon.

     My rather expensive <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermaccube/">stereo</a> has arrived.  The sound is <em>absolutely amazing</em>.  (I had no idea that those teensy speakers could sound so <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~tbonepage/">round</a> and <a href="http://www.tmtm.com/sam/burnett/criminal.html">textured</a>.)

One day, when the network people recognise its hardware address, I might use it to browse the web, and once it gets upgraded in memory from its currently poky 64MB to something useable in this day and age, it will get a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent operating system</a> and it will become my desktop computer at work.  But for now, it makes a gorgeous desktop stereo.  And that's OK.

     <b>Today's revelation</b>:  This morning, contemplating the break from teaching, I discovered that the writing project I have thoughtfully filed away to do in <em>January</em> (while sprawled in front of the box watching the cricket on the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/grandstand">radio</a>, as is my habit) requires roughly 5 pages a day.  For the whole month.  Damn those large <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html#rle">handbook articles</a>!  
<p>
Now, it's a subject I <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/">know</a>, none of the material is really <em>new</em>, I have an outline on paper, and the structure seems sound, so writing it is not exactly jumping into the void.  However, it will require an interesting degree of application to convert the outline into a finished piece of work.
<p>
Perhaps this log will take a hiatus over summer.

     Well, <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_11_01_archive/#1493313">that</a> was successful.  The typical academic department power struggle, with the contenders for the Head of <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/">Department</a> job silently circling each other, thinking "I don't want to do it", "Not me" and "Why not her/him?" has come to what at least seems to be successful conclusion.

     Still working.  (Though from home, and not from work.)   At the moment, I'm doing my duty for the profession by refereeing papers.  I should do this in a black mood, because then I'd reject more papers.  But, kindly soul that I can be, I tend to say nice things about them, thus contributing to the flood of publications out there.

     It's the <em>cricket</em> season at last.  And despite a rather <a href="http://www-aus4.cricket.org/link_to_database/NEW/LIVE/frames/WI_AUS_T1_23-27NOV2000.html">one-sided day's play</a>, and the prospect of a one-sided <a href="http://www-aus4.cricket.org/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/2000-01/WI_IN_AUS/">series</a>, it's still a distinctive start to the long languid summer for me.

<blockquote>
The [Microsoft] Tablet PC has a 500 to 600-MHz CPU, 128MB of RAM, a 10GB hard disk, and universal serial bus (USB) ports for keyboard and mouse, said Microsoft software architect Bert Keeley, who demonstrated the tablet during Gates' keynote. It runs Whistler, the next version of Microsoft Windows 2000.
<p>
The Tablet PC can convert handwritten pen strokes into graphics that can be handled in ways similar to ordinary computer type. Although the computer doesn't recognize specific words, it distinguishes between words and pictures. It also lets people perform some word processing-like tasks, such as inserting space between lines, copying text or boldfacing pen strokes.

Surely they can do better than that.  I want my handwritten text to be treated as <em>text</em>.

     <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_11_01_archive.html">It</a> was revealing.  The baby seems well.  Spectacularly so, when you see the four-chambered heart regularly beating, and arms and legs waving around.  As Christine was poked and prodded, pushed and pulled, I was slack-jawed, managing only to say "wow", "that's incredible" and "isn't it amazing."
<p>
Waiting at the train station, we noted that this was probably the only time you get to see amazingly thorough cross-sections of a person.  Or so we hope, for this particular small person.
<p>
Oh, we know the baby's sex too.  But I'll write references to the baby in carefully gender-neutral language for those who want a suprise later.  (But feel free to ask me, if you like.  It's not a secret, or anything.)

     The <a href="http://www.tobintax.org/">Tobin</a> <a href="http://www.tobintax.org.uk/">Tax</a>
is a <em>very</em> interesting idea.  Tax cross-border currency transactions at a miniscule amount, resulting in slightly calmed waters of the currency market, and <em>lots</em> of money for international initiatives such as alleviating poverty.  It's an idea worth campaigning for.

     Xanana Gusmao is a pretty inspiring character when you hear him.  He's in town to <a href="http://www.iidnet.org/apcet/gusmao-awarded-sydney-peace-prize.htm">receive</a> the <a href="http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/Arts/departs/cpacs/Events.htm">Sydney Peace Prize</a> (for some reason, the <a href="http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/Arts/departs/cpacs/cpacmain.htm">Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies</a> don't update their web page, so there's information there about <em>last year</em>'s prize).
<p>
Anyway, a rebel leader who says that revolutionary guerilla fighters do not necessarily make good heads of state, and who thinks that it would not necessarily be a <em>good idea</em> for him to be president of a free East Timor, seems to good sense.  He's got more concern of the well-being of his people than many other leaders in this world.

     I'm not as hard on Cauchy as <a href="http://www.freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/2000_11_05_archive/#1277800">Brenda is</a>.  It does <em>seem</em> like Cauchy is an arrogant guy when you hear what's named after him, but as far as I can tell in this game, people almost never name theorems after themselves.  We can blame other parties for that.  
<p>
I've taken to calling a wonderful theorem the <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/">Belnap's Pair Extension Theorem</a>.  No-one would ever accuse <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~belnap">Nuel</a> of arrogantly 
claiming the theorem for himself.  I'd wager that this third parties are overwhelmingly primary source of attributions, and that naming a result after yourself is <em>extremely</em> rare.
<p>
Some historian/sociologist of mathematics should do the hard yards and study the nature of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mathematics+attribution">attribution</a> in the mathematical sciences.  I'm no historian, but I think there are a lot of interesting discoveries to be made here.
<p>
As to <em>policy</em>, I don't think that dubbing a theorem <em>X</em>'s Theorem is particularly enlightening.  I'd much rather call it <em>X</em>'s <em>F</em> Theorem, where <em>F</em> is descriptive.  That way, if history decides the attribution differently, my attribution to <em>X</em> could "wear off", and people still have some idea of what I was talking about.<sup>*</sup>
