The <a href="http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/ecq/election01/election01s.html">2001 Queensland Election</a> was fun to witness.  (Go <a href="http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/ecq/election01/cand/cand217.html">John</a>!)  It's surprising when a conservative federal MP <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/qldelection/eqld-19feb2001-4.htm">says</a> that the stunning victory by the ALP was the best possible outcome, but then, politics is never completely straightforward in Queensland.

     <a href="/images/HarbourBridge.jpg"><img src="/images/HarbourBridgeSm.jpg" alt="[A Bridge]" width="300" height="200" border="1" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></a>This last week has been one of reorientation.  Not only have I been able to throw out one and a half large bins of paper from my office, but almost all things which need filing have been filed, and almost all things which need doing have been ... well, <em>some</em> of them have been done, and the rest have been put on my list of things to do.   This list now contains over 50 items, but at least they're where I can see them, instead of languishing around in my office waiting to scare me when I tip over a pile of papers under which they've been ignored.
<p>
The best part was throwing away half of the contents of my filing cabinet (and my large boxes of things to be filed in the filing cabinet whenever I got the time) when I realised that I had copies of these papers neatly filed away on my computer as pdf or postscript or dvi files.  (I'm an academic, I collect papers by other people.  It's a great way to avoid <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/cv.html">writing them</a> yourself.)  Anyway, it's much more productive for these things to be filed away on my hard disk than filed away in my filing cabinet, because my computer is smart enough to index the disk, and I can search for papers by looking for words I know feature prominently.  (This is in case I forget the author and title of the paper.)   The point is this: I'd like the rest of my filing cabinet to be in my computer too.  To do that, I'd need to scan those papers.  (Or get files for them in some other way, I suppose.)  To scan the papers I'll need a scanner (not too hard to access) and software.   Here's where you come in.  I want to know if there's software which will do the following:
<ul>
<li> Scan a multiple page paper and produce files identical in layout/pagebreaks/linebreaks/etc
to the original paper.    That is, each page is a real replica of the corresponding page of the paper I'm scanning.  Including the silly technical symbols you're prone to find in logic papers.  (That's easy.  An image file is an easy file to create.)
<li> Create a file in a type which is publically documented and will not become obselete in the near future.  So, Postscript and PDF are fine, JPEG too, but Microsoft Word DOC files are not.  (This is easy too,  I think that Adobe Acrobat will do these two for me, scanning papers into pdf.)
<li> At the same time as those requirements, I'd like the text of the paper to be scanned and encoded <em>as text</em> so that the paper can be indexed along with the rest of the documents on my disk.  I know that this can be done.  The people at <a href="http://www.octavo.com/">Octavo</a> have done it in style with old manuscripts.  Is there any way for this to be done affordably by mere mortals such as myself?
</ul>
Once you've answered this question, reward yourself by browsing through this <a href="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/">journal of online opinion</a>.

     It's <em>cleaning out the office</em> week, and I've been distracted by piles of student assessment forms from days gone by.  In 1998 I was on the team, teaching <a href="http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/PHIL137/">Critical Thinking</a> (then called the sexy <em>Reasoning and Logic</em>, before we did our market research).  One comment says
<blockquote>
Although I disliked the subject I thought Greg was a highlight &amp; was a great teacher.  It's a shame he teaches logic though.
</blockquote>
And the next:
<blockquote>
Shame someone so humorous (lectures were always funny) had to deal with something so sterile and tedious as truth tables.
</blockquote>
I even had students happily write that they didn't fall asleep once on my classes.  1998 was a mixed year.  Students liked me but didn't like the subject.
<p>
Would I prefer it if they fell in love with the subject, but didn't like me?

     There are some things you can truly admit to have learned through years of experience, and my knowledge of vending machines is one of these.  Let me share an experience from yesterday.  
<p>
It was time for my afternoon coffee, and with the <em>Grant Application Writing</em> going slowly, I felt the strange desire for one of the large chocolate chip biscuits (a "cookie" for you American readers) available from the downstairs vending machine.  So, out of the office I get, and down six flights of stairs to the ground floor of my building to the vending machines.  On the way, I check my wallet.  Two two dollar coins.  I know that the biscuits are $1.60 -- you pay a premium price for those large chunks of chocolate -- so I consider myself well equipped for the vending machine.  A chocolate chip biscuit will be mine.
<p>
Down on the ground floor, in front of the vending machine, spying the bottom right row to check on the supply of chocolate biscuity goodness (check!) I get one $2 coin and put it in the slot.
<p>
It makes its journey, not to the money bin in the machine, but directly to the <em>coin return slot</em>.  I try it again, after checking that the coin isn't malformed in any way.  Again, the journey is swift, but my coin is rejected.  I check the machine, and only then do I notice the "correct change required" sign flashing right next to the coin slot.  This makes sense.  If the machine requires correct change today, it will reject a $2 coin, because the $1.60 chocolate biscuit is the most expensive of the delights it holds.  But now I have a problem.  The machine wants exact change.  I have two $2 coins.  I have no other cash.  I want a chocolate chip biscuit.
<p>
Fortunately, this desire can be met because of the <em>other</em> vending machines in the room.  Next to the confectionary machine with your standard chips, chocolates, and sundry things to much is the dreaded Coca Cola machine.  It will accept $2 coins, but it is notorious for accepting them and giving you nothing in return.  No solace there.  No, my salvation will come from the much despised $1coffee, tea and hot chocolate machine.  The coffee, tea and hot chocolate from the machine is no doubt excerable.  (My coffee is nicely brewing upstairs thankyou very much.)  However, the machine is a necessary step on my journey to fulfilment.  This machine also accepts $2 coins.  So I put in $2.  Then, I decide that I do not want a hot beverage from this machine.  So I press the "reject" button.  The machine thinks.  This person gave me $2.  I must give this person $2 back.  It does.  In the form of two $1 coins.
<p>
Now I am on my way.  I consider putting one $1 coin back in the machine and pressing "reject" again to see if I will get any closer to my goal of getting 60 cents in change, but I think better of it.  Chances are, the machine is filled with $1 coins.   No, I have $1 now, and that is perfectly acceptable to go into my original vending machine.  No in it goes.  Remember this is the machine which thinks you must put in your exact change.  (This is basically a licence for the machine to not give you any change if you put in $1.60 for an item worth $1.50.)  Well, I put in $1, and then press the reject button.  And what do you know?  This machine, which allegedly is running low on small denomination coins and will require exact change, dispenses $1 for me, in five 20 cent coins. 
<p>
Thankyou very much, O gods of vending machines!  Three of these newly dispensed 20s, together with my one $1 coin later, I ascend (in a lift) with my sugar kick for the afternoon.

The Grant Application still isn't written.
