<p>While I was busy writing my most recent paper, &ldquo;<a href="http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/">Proof Terms for Classical Derivations</a>&rdquo;, I heard that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/raymond-smullyan-dead-puzzle-creator.html?smid=tw-share">Raymond Smullyan had died at the age of 97</a>. I <a href="https://t.co/g5e54e0eo6">posted a tweet</a> with a photo of a page from the draft of the paper I was writing at the time, expressing loss at hearing of his death and gratitude for his life.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to love Professor Smullyan. I learned combinatory logic from his delightful puzzle book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mock-Mockingbird-Raymond-Smullyan/dp/0192801422/consequentlyorg">To Mock a Mockingbird</a></em>, and he was famous for many more puzzle books like that. He was not only bright and sharp, he was also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Silent-Raymond-M-Smullyan/dp/0060674695/consequentlyorg">warmly</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Who-Knows-Study-Religious-Consciousness/dp/0253215749/">humane</a>. However, the focus of my gratitude was something else. In my tweet, I hinted at one reason why I&rsquo;m especially grateful for Smullyan&rsquo;s genius&mdash;his deep understanding of proof theory. I am convinced that his analysis of inference rules in the tableaux system for classical logic rewards repeated reflection. (See his <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Order-Logic-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486683702/consequentlyorg">First-Order Logic</a></em>, Chapter 2, Section 1 for details.) I&rsquo;ll try to explain why it&rsquo;s important and insightful here.</p>

<p></p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In memory of Raymond Smullyan (1919-2017), with appreciation, fondness, and a sense of loss. <a href="https://t.co/g5e54e0eo6">pic.twitter.com/g5e54e0eo6</a></p>&mdash; Greg Restall (@consequently) <a href="https://twitter.com/consequently/status/829517048346705921">February 9, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Step back a moment and think about <em>proof theory</em>, that branch of logic which concentrates&mdash;unlike model theory&mdash;on the <em>positive</em> definition of the core logical notions of validity, inconsistency, etc. An argument is valid if and only if <em>there is some</em> proof from the premises to the conclusion. A set of sentences is inconsistent if and only if <em>there is some</em> refutation of (i.e., proof of a contradiction from) that set of sentences. On the contrary, model theoretic approaches define those notions negatively. An argument is valid if and only if <em>there is no</em> model satisfying the premises but failing to satisfy the conclusion; a set of sentences is inconsistent if <em>there is no</em> model satisfying all of them. For proof theory to be precise, we need to know what counts as a proof. The way this is typically done in different accounts of proof (whether <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Deduction-Proof-Theoretical-Study-Mathematics/dp/0486446557/consequentlyorg">natural deduction</a>, Gentzen&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Cambridge-Theoretical-Computer-Science/dp/0521779111/consequentlyorg">sequent</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structural-Proof-Theory-Professor-Negri/dp/0521068428/consequentlyorg">calculus</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Order-Logic-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486683702/consequentlyorg">tableaux</a>), there are different rules for each different logical connective or quantifier. In well behaved proof systems, there tend to be two rules for each connective, explaining what you can deduce <em>from</em> (for example) a conjunction, and how you could make a deduction <em>to</em> a conjunction. The same for a conditional, a disjunction, a negation, a universally quantified statement, and so on.</p>

<p>That makes for a <em>lot</em> of different rules.</p>

<p>A <em>proof</em> is then is some structured collection of statements, linked together in ways specified by the rules. You demonstrate things <em>about</em> proofs typically by showing that the feature you want to prove holds for <em>basic</em> proofs (the smallest possible cases), and then you show that if the property holds for a proof, it also holds for a proof you can make out of that one by extending it by a new inference step. If you have \(9\) different rules, then there are \(9\) different cases to check. Worse than that, if you were <em>mad enough</em> to try to <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations">prove something about what happens when you rearrange proofs</a> by swapping inference steps around, then welcome to the world of combinatorial explosion of cases. If you have \(9\) different kinds of rules, then there are \(9 \times 9 = 81\) different cases you have to consider. There&rsquo;s something inherently unsatisfying about having to consider \(81\) different cases in a proof. You have the nagging feeling that you&rsquo;re not looking at this at the right level of complexity. There is no wonder that the insightful and influential proof theorist <a href="http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~girard/Accueil.html">Jean-Yves Girard</a> complained:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One can see &hellip; technical limitations in current proof-theory: The lack in <em>modularity</em>: in general, neigbouring problems can be attacked by neighbouring methods; but it is only exceptionally that one of the problems will be a corollary of the other &hellip; Most of the time, a completely new proof will be necessary (but without any new idea).  This renders work in the domain quite long and tedious.  For instance, if we prove a cut-elimination theorem for a certain system of rules, and then consider a new system including just a new pair of rules, then it is necessary to make a complete new proof from the beginning.  Of course 90% of the two proofs will be identical, but it is rather shocking not to have a reasonable &laquo;modular&raquo; approach to such a question: a main theorem, to which one could add various &laquo;modules&raquo; corresponding to various directions.  Maybe this is inherent in the subject; one may hope that this only reflects the rather low level of our conceptualization!</p>

<p>&mdash; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Theory-Logical-Complexity-Studies/dp/0444987150/consequentlyorg">Proof Theory and Logical Complexity</a>, pages 15 and 16.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of permutations of rules, the usual proof of a theorem like this would have \(n\times n\) cases where you have a proof system with \(n\) different inference rules. And if you decided to try to extend your result it to a proof system with another \(m\) rules, you not only need to prove the fact all over again for your new rules, you also need to one-by-one add the \(n\times m\) cases of interaction betwen the old rules and your new ones. Ugh.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where Smullyan&rsquo;s insight comes in. He divided the rules of his tableaux system for classical propositional logic into two kinds. The \(\alpha\) (linear) rules are single-premise single-conclusion rules, while the \(\beta\) (branching) rules infer a conclusion from <em>two</em> premises.  It turns out that you can prove very many things about rules operating at this level of generality.  Many features of rules are shared by <em>all</em> \(\alpha\) rules or <em>all</em> \(\beta\) rules. And in <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations">my paper</a> I was pleased to see that the \(81\) different cases of permutations I had to consider could be simplified into \(3\) different cases. Swapping an \(\alpha\) step around an \(\alpha\) step; a \(\beta\) around a \(\beta\) and an \(\alpha\) around a \(\beta\) (and back). Instead of writing a paper where I considered \(n\) different cases out of \(81\), and leave the rest to the reader, using Smullyan&rsquo;s insight I could show that any rules of the required two general shapes can be permuted around using the general schemas I formulate. Every case is covered. And what&rsquo;s more, if you extend the proof system with <em>other</em> rules, provided that they are \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\) rules, the results still hold.  It&rsquo;s a much better way to do proof theory. It&rsquo;s a <em>modular</em> proof of a theorem, in just the way that Girard hoped for.</p>

<p>Thanks, Professor Smullyan!</p>
