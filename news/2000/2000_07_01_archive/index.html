     Phil's email reminded me too of the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing">Background Briefing</a> program on University quality in Australia.  The <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/s153481.htm">transcript</a> of that saddening program is now available.  There's some provocative stuff in the <a href="http://highered.theoz.com.au/">Higher Ed</a> site at the <a href="http://www.theoz.com.au/">The Australian</a>.  It's a pity that the terrible design of the site makes it well-nigh impossible to link to. 
<p>
Higher education policy will probably play at least a small part in the upcoming federal election.  It ought to, as the higher education sector is in terrible crisis, with pay rises being awarded, unfunded from the <a href="www.detya.gov.au">Commonwealth</a>.  Salaries have gone up roughly 12% in the last 5 years or so, while funding to the universities has remained static.  Student numbers have gone through the roof, but staff numbers have shrunk.  Hence, class sizes rise, staff-student ratios drop, and <a href="http://www.nteu.org.au/debates/workload00.html">everyone's unhappy</a>.  A structural crunch is coming.

     Well, as of this afternoon, the <a href="#527029">numbers</a> are <b>502</b>, so the traditional "after the first lecture where people get to see what's in store" drop-off hasn't happened yet.  
<p>
The lecture last night was a blast for me.  It was good to get back into the saddle and attempt to entertain and educate a large group.  Apparently, at least a few enjoyed themselves: I got this email from a student:
<blockquote>
Great lecture Greg.........considering I only have  to come
in for the PHIL lecture on a Thursday...I figured I'd just
stay at home...but your acerbic wit will no doubt be
tempting enough for me to get into my 20 year old Sigma and drive to uni...heh heh heh keep it up.

     <a href="http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/~wgrey/morsoc/">Ian Hinckfuss: The Moral Society -- Its Structure and Effects</a>, is now online.  <a href="http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/~hinck/hinck.html">Hinck</a> taught me moral philosophy, logic, metaphysics, and many other things besides, while I was a Ph.D. student at the University of Queensland.  He was one of the kindest, gentlest and warmest human beings I've had the pleasure to know, and his death was a devastating loss to all of us who were in his orbit.  I can still remember his infectious laugh, his outrage at injustice (though, of course, he wouldn't put it that way!) and his sharp intellect.  I can only hope that I have half the effect on others that he has had on me, and on the rest of the Australian philosophical community.
<p>
So, in his memory, read his <a href="http://www.arts.uq.edu.au/~wgrey/morsoc/">passionate, reasoned and sustained defence of amoralism</a>.

     So <em><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2607921,00.html">that's</a></em> what the handwriting recognition guys from the Newton project have been doing with their free time.  As far as I can tell, handwriting recognition only catches on with devices in which a keyboard is unavailable.  I can't see this catching on as a useful input method for desktop or laptop devices where a keyboard is right there.  Now, for a <em>slate</em>, <em>tablet</em> or <em>palmtop</em> it would make sense.  Let's see what they have in store for us.  (It was touching to see the font <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/graphics/library/0007/0007ink/ink2.html">Casual</a>, and the little caret insertion point back in action too.)

     Here's more thoughtful analysis from <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/">Joel on Software</a>: <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$139">Does Issuing Passports Make Microsoft a Country?</a>  I'm not a Microsoft Passport user, and I'm mighty glad that I'm not, after reading this article.  You should read this article too, if you browse the web.  It's got a very good explanation of how cookies work.
<p>
One thing I <em>like</em> about how Mac OS 9 works is the <em>keychain</em>.  I keep a local copy of all of my account passwords on my computer, protected with a master password.  I can allow my network programs access to the keychain, and I need to know one password to unlock the master keychain.  This is great for my personal accounts on other machines, and to get into ftp directories (such as on this university webserver at Macqurie.)  However, the <em>web browsers</em> don't use Keychain, so I still need to remember my passwords for all of these web services, like Blogger, Amazon, my <a href="http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/PHIL134">web courseware</a> and so on.  (Better yet will be when I can access my local machine anywhere on the network, so I don't have to keep two local copies on my two regularly-used machines.)  So we're not there yet.  Still, this technique of password management seems much better than the kind of centralised repository in the clutches of an organisation who can sell my data.

     I'm back in the groove at work.  Lots of students, lots of energy.  I've even got time to do just a <em>little</em> research for a project that's been at the back of my head for a few years.  (If anyone has any experience in anaphora, epsilon terms and modal or intensional logic, please <a href="mailto:Greg.Restall@mq.edu.au">contact me</a>.  It's esoteric, but that's one of the costs of being a logician.)

     Someone make it stop.  I've got <b>464</b> students now.  Where are they coming from?
<p>
Seriously, this is both a good and a bad thing.  I <em>like</em> that I have lots of students wanting to learn logic.  That's nice.  I think every university student ought to do some logic.  However, large classes (mine will stabilise down to around 400, I think) are difficult to teach.  Yes, there's the delight of the <em>theatricality</em> of having 400 students laughing at your jokes, and obviously wanting to <em>learn</em>. (No, I don't have a starry-eyed view of the university students of our era.  I am exceedingly lucky, however, to have students who do my subjects because they <em>want</em> to.  Intro Logic is not a required unit for <em>any</em> degree in this university.  People are doing this unit because it's fun, and because they've heard about it from friends.)
<p>
All that is one thing, however.  Teaching 400 has its pains and trials.  It's hard to give the 20% of students who really need hands-on attention the attention they deserve.  It's hard to give the 20% who thrive on being stretched to do new things the attention they deserve.  Attention can only spread so far.
<p>
Still, this large enrolment pays for my job.  I should be grateful.  I am.

     I paid a visit to the dentist this morning.  It brought back bad memories of my early teens, with four extractions (badly done) and painful braces getting my teeth in order. My family weren't well off, and I went to the government funded dental hospital in Brisbane.  The dentists there seemed extraordinarily brutal, and I have avoided dentists ever since.  Well, the visit to the dentist today was good.  I needed major work on a tooth, which did involve some pain, but nothing like my traumatic memories of past dental encounters.  This time, good sense, yoga practice (breathing is your friend!), curiosity about the kind of pain you feel when <em>that</em> nerve is stimulated, and knowledge that I was not going to die from it, all added up into a much less difficult experience.

     Just got out of a 2.5 hour meeting, the highlight of which is news that the apocalypse will be held in 2002.   This is the first year we will turn our undergraduate timetabling over to a massive <a href="http://arp.anu.edu.au/~jks/finder.html">constraint satisfaction problem solver</a>.   I look forward to the outcry from staff and students to the timetabling of their lectures at 5pm on Friday.    That's of course conditional upon the changes actually occurring.  Given the minimal predictive value of any institutional statement of the form "<em>x</em> will happen in a year's time" I have no doubt that it <em>won't</em> happen as stated.  It will, no doubt, be much worse.

     Hmmm.  Microsoft wants our software to do <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/biztech/articles/17lab.html">Bayesian reasoning</a> to schedule our meetings and to know when it's worthwhile to interrupt me? Now, I get a moderate amount of email (upward of 50 messages a day?) but I prefer being in control of this myself.  Simple rule based filters are a good thing.  A computer running a hacked up calculus on its messages is going to be a <em>Bad Thing</em> if it means I have to do lots of work to figure out where that important message went, or why I have a meeting scheduled for 10am tomorrow.  No, I have to learn to <em>trust</em> complex agents, and I don't think software agents will garner that trust for quite some time.

     Oh dear.  More <a href="http://www.feedmag.com/essay/es359lofi.html">confusion</a> about the nature of time.  Julian Barbour's stuff is interesting, when it comes to showing that our uninformed conception of time and its passing is confused and in conflict with the findings of modern science.  But to say that as a result, time doesn't <em>exist</em>?  I suppose it gets you more headlines than saying "not everything we thought about time is correct."  This kind of na&iuml;ve popularisation gives theoretical physics a bad name.

My order shipped against my wishes -- the galling thing was that the two CDs I had on one click ordering were shipped <em>separately</em> desipite both being in stock at the time of order.  I had selected them with one-click ordering, then the shop closed for an hour, and after I got back on I tried to cancel my order.   They couldn't be cancelled.  I sent off an irate email, and I got a suprisingly nice reply.  Yes, they agreed, they'd stuffed up.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000025ZP8/">One CD</a> was already on its way, but they'd try to stop the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000001176/">other</a> before it left US shores.  For the CD on its way, they'd airmail a return pack to me, and ask me to return the CD when I got it, then they'd credit my card.  (Which, needless to say, had already been debited for both CDs.) Now, knowing my own capacity for self-control, I knew I wouldn't resist when faced with a small cardboard box between me and a Keith Jarrett CD which was, legally, mine.  So, I wasn't happy with this solution.  No, I said: my main problem was the shipping charges.  Why not charge me for only one shipment?  (That gets the total charge just a tad under the AUS$30 per CD we pay in shops.)  I then get both CDs without having to ship one back and then order it <em>again</em>, hoping that they don't stuff it up a second time.  It suprised me when they said <em>yes</em> that would do nicely, and they cancelled <em>both</em> shipping charges.  I'm enjoying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000001176/">T-Bone Burnett</a> now.
<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/music-glance/B000025ZP8/"><img src="/images/keithjarrettparis.jpeg" alt="[Keith Jarrett Paris Concert]" width="130" height="130" border="1" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></a>The moral of the story seems to be this: it was obvious that I was dealing with a human being throughout the email discussion.  It was the same person who read and replied to both my emails, and she was flexible enough, and empowered enough, to evaluate and act on my requests.  In doing this, Amazon at least begins to <em>approximate</em> a real live store with real live people I can have real live conversations with.  
<p>
Imagine what would happen if you were browsing in a physical shop, with a few selections in a basket, and the shop suddenly announced that it was closed and they were immediately charging you for what you had on hand?  What possible responses could you make?  To whom?  If you know you're dealing with a person who has some degree of understanding of the situation, then you're much more likely to get a reasonable outcome.  If you deal with the corporation as a whole, you never know that your whole story has been listened to.  Your pleas get sucked into a void, and it's not clear that <em>anyone</em> has the whole picture.  I know which kind of corporation I prefer dealing with.
<p>
Unfortunately, I have no assurance that the economic conditions encourage this kind of personal attention from individuals inside corporations.  I do know that the dynamic of increased staff-student ratios inside universities make it increasingly harder for me to treat my students individually.  I don't see that this pressure is going to abate in either my academic environment, or the corporate world.

     Well there you go: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_825000/825641.stm">Ridley Scott thinks that Deckard is a replicant</a>.  Now the BBC are reporting this as meaning that Deckard <em>is</em> a replicant, but I don't see that this follows.  
<p>
A director can say whatever he/she likes about significance of a film.  It doesn't follow that this is what the film <em>means</em>.  If Scott makes the film ambiguous, so that it can be legitimately interpreted in a couple of ways (as Blade Runner manifestly can), then not even his own say-so renders one of those interpretations as the only appropriate one.  If he wanted us to take Deckard to be a replicant, he should have made the <em>film</em> say so.  I <em>like</em> the fact that the film is ambiguous.
<p>
<span class="sml">[Disclaimer: I note that I might be taken to be a relativist there's-no-absolute-truth philosopher here because I'm denying the primacy of authorial intent in interpretation.  But that would also be inappropriate to deduce.  I'm saying this out of respect for what the film says (and for what it doesn't say), not because I think that everything can be legitimately interpreted in every-which-way.]

     Did I mention that last Monday night's <a href="http://abc.net.au/thegames/howard.htm">apology</a> from <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/seachange/bob.htm">John Howard</a> was extremely moving?

Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by<br />
you never get to stop and open your eyes<br />
one day you're waiting for the sky to fall<br />
the next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all<br />
when you're lovers in a dangerous time<br />
lovers in a dangerous time
<p>
These fragile bodies of touch and taste<br />
this vibrant skin -- this hair like lace<br />
spirits open to the thrust of grace<br />
never a breath you can afford to waste<br />
when you're lovers in a dangerous time<br />
lovers in a dangerous time
<p>
When you're lovers in a dangerous time<br />
sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime --<br />
but nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight --
<br />got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight<br />
when you're lovers in a dangerous time<br />
lovers in a dangerous time<br />
and we're lovers in a dangerous time<br />
lovers in a dangerous time

(Actually, it was last night's song, which struck me again when driving at 8:30pm last night.  The joys of rediscovery, facilitated by those rarely listened-to cassettes in the car.)

     I'm back in Sydney.  And completely conferenced out.  And not going to write anything more here until I'm unpacked, and I have some of my life (and my email, which piles up) sorted out.  You'll hear from me tomorrow.  Or Monday, maybe.

     <a href="http://pluralism.pitas.com/">Rushing, rushing, rushing</a>.  There's lots happening.  Almost <em>none</em> of which involves me sitting in front of my computer.  This is a <em>good thing</em> as a change.  The first <a href="http://www.usc.edu.au/News/conf/aal/index.html">conference</a> was great, and the <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/~pddhyde/aap2000.html">second</a> is going well too.  I always relax after giving my own talk, and given that this was scheduled on Monday morning, the rest of my time should be relaxing and enjoyable.  (Except for missing Christine, who I just took to the airport so she could fly back to Sydney.)
