     Wisdom, from <a href="http://www.freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/">Brenda</a>: <a href="http://www.freespeech.org/looseassociations/isomorphisms/2000_12_17_archive/#1732199">Good mathematics, like good cinema, must leave something to the imagination.</a>
<p>
This is handy to know, as I'm meant to be spending this week rewriting my unit notes for <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/ug/281/">this</a>.  And yes, Brenda's statement is relevant, because about 50% of this unit is straight <em>mathematics</em>, despite the <em>philosophy</em> tag the units get.  For example,  I'll be helping my students absorbe and understand two or three <em>completeness theorems</em>, which are reasonably heavy-duty mathematical results.  
<p>
It's always a struggle to formulate the best way to introduce new concepts and techniques, but the look on students' faces as they <em>get it</em> is more than adequate recompense.   (Well, together with the salary I take home.)

     Add my voice to what <a href="http://grudnuk.com/vm/">he said</a> about the cabinet reshuffle.  Add to that a general worry about Ms. Vanstone in <em>Family and Community Services</em>.  Given her "<a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/students/mpa/compass/97/budget.htm">performance</a>" in Education, we'll see how she deals with this poisoned chalice.  (Notice the only position in Cabinet that this government can ever find for a woman is "Family and Community Services".  Exactly <em>where</em> is a woman's place in this world?)

     <a href="http://slate.msn.com/framegame/entries/00-12-07_94796.asp">Here</a> is a wonderful collection of pieces of reasoning.  An example distilled from some current US political rhetoric:
<blockquote>
The electorate gave half its mandate to Bush and half to Gore. You are a member of the electorate. Therefore, you gave half your mandate to Bush and half to Gore. Therefore, you voted for an agenda that is not centered around a party philosophy. Bush's agenda is not centered around a party philosophy. Therefore, you voted for Bush's agenda. Bush's agenda includes tax cuts and partial privatization of Social Security. Therefore, you voted for tax cuts and partial privatization of Social Security.</blockquote>
The fact that the actual <em>reasoning</em> contained in so much political rhetoric is so <em>bad</em> should make you think that something else is going on in that kind of talk.  What ever it is, it isn't the giving of reasons, it's not dialogue, and it's not clarifying issues.

We even managed to beat the dealer down significantly on price, and to accept our decrepit car as a trade-in.  We pick it up on Tuesday.  Our only constraint was that we'd buy it if it was in decent working order, and if they'd accept our wreck of a car, but when the dealer actually asks you <em>so what <em>is</em> your limit?</em> you have to name something significantly lower than the price they're asking for, just to see if they'll come at it.

     I interrupt this broadcast to present a <em>puzzle</em> for you.  There'll 
be <em>fame</em>, <em>fortune</em> and <em>gratitude</em><sup 
style="font-size:80%">1</sup> for you if you can give me a positive 
response.  Here goes:

<blockquote>
Find a metric space <b>D</b> with an uniformly continuous isomorphism 
<b>f</b> to the metric function space <b>[D -&gt; I]</b> of uniformly 
continuous functions from <b>D</b> to the unit interval <b>I</b>.
</blockquote>

Now for some explanations and clarifications:
<p>
<em>First</em>: I don't care what metric you equip the function space <b>[D -&gt; 
I]</b> with.  What I do care is that it's the space of all absolutely 
continuous functions from <b>D</b> to the unit interval.  And I care that 
the isomorphism <b>f</b> itself be uniformly continuous too.

<p>
<em>Second</em>: You might find this question rather similar to what <a 
href="www.google.com/search?q=domain+theory">domain theorists</a> have 
done.  The famous result of Scott is to construct a space <b>D</b> 
isomorphic to the space <b>[D -&gt; D]</b> of continuous functions from 
<b>D</b> to itself.  This is an ingenious iterative construction.  (And he 
uses it to construct a model of the lambda calculus.)  My inexpert attempt 
at doing the same sort of thing (while on the train on the way home today) 
crashed and burned.  I have no idea if these techniques can be made to work 
for my problem.

<p>
<em>Third</em>: If there's a nice proof of the existence of such a space, 
there's a nice explanation of the consistency of a naive theory of classes, 
despite Russell's paradox.  The trick is turned, as usual, by stuffing 
around with the logic.  (Here it's Lukasiewicz's infinitely valued logic 
which is in my sights.)  The nice thing here is that the existence of this 
function space will give us a consistency proof by what are hopefully 
insightful <em>semantic</em> technqiues, rather than the dry axiom-chopping 
usual for such consistency proofs.

<p>
<sup style="font-size:80%">1</sup>Perhaps not in equal quantities.
<p>
I now return you to your previously scheduled programming.

     The magazine inside the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/">weekend paper</a> had a few pages on the amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582341001/">Atlas of Experience</a> by cartographers Jean Klare and Louise van Swaaij.  Words don't do it justice: it is literally an atlas of human experience.  Pages and pages of maps, covering change, adversity, regret, food (both fast food and haute cuisine), forgetfulness and much much more.  It's landed on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1BCBQOXGSX906/">wishlist</a>.
<p>
These maps reminded me of <a href="http://www.lisson.co.uk/theArtists/Patterson/simonpatterson.html">Simon Patterson</a>'s <a href="http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Aest/AestFitz.htm">The Great Bear</a> which replaces station names on a map of the London Underground with famous personages (so the lines feature <em>Comedians</em>, <em>Philosophers</em>, etc, which makes the choice of people at the intersections often a delight).  Why?  It's the spatial representation of non-spatial relationships.

<p>
For some reason, the crossword online is not the same as the one in the newspaper.  And no, I can usually complete about <em>one</em> entry in a cryptic crossword.  (For a starter about how to do these things, and a great Australian Music puzzle, try Adam Spencer's puzzle for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/ausmusicmonth/crossword/default.htm#hints">Australian Music Month</a>.)
