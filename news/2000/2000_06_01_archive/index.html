     Just about to get on the train to the airport, and I want to check my bank details on the web.  Oddly, the domain name servers are screwy today.  I can access some websites at without their "www" prefixes (such as <a href="http://weblogs.com/">weblogs.com</a>) but not with them (like <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">www.weblogs.com</a>).  I can get to my bank website OK, but through a nonstandard domain name, and this means that the security certificate isn't accepted by my browser, and the connection isn't secure.   Does anyone know what DNS problems could cause this?

     It is a strange thing being an <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/">author</a>.  Not only do you get stupid feelings in a bookshop (if your book is not there, it is evidence it is not popular because the bookshop is not stocking it; if it is there, it is evidence that it is not selling), your ever helpful readers who send you  <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/errata.html">corrections</a> leave you in quite some doubt if anyone has actually made it past the <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/isl/errata.html">first half of the book</a>.

     A disruption is a nice way to start the day.  We had booked for some floor sanders and polishers to come and (what do you expect?) sand and polish our floors.  Our hallway, to be precise.  The booking was, I had thought, for Monday and Tuesday, with a possible extension to Wednesday to accomodate drying time.  Just in time for us to jet up to Noosa for a <a href="http://www.usc.edu.au/News/conf/aal/index.html">conference</a>.  It turns out that they had taken the booking to involve starting on Monday <em>or</em> Tuesday.  Given that apparently <em>everyone</em> in Sydney is getting their floors polished this week before the <a href="http://taxreform.ato.gov.au/">apocalypse</a>, "Monday or Tuesday" means "Tuesday" or possibly "Wednesday." Well, this screws all our plans up mightily.  <em>Excellent</em>.

     Excuse me a minute for a little theological &amp; personal reflection
<blockquote class="sml">
We may trust God with our past as heartily as with our future.  It will not hurt us so long as we do not try to hide things, so long as we are ready to bow our heads in hearty shame where it is fit we should be ashamed.  For to be ashamed is a holy and blessed thing.  Shame is a thing to shame only those who want to <em>appear</em>, not to those who want to <em>be</em>.  Shame is shame to those who want to pass their examination, not those who would get into the heart of things . . . To be humbly ashamed is to be plunged into the cleansing bath of truth.
</blockquote>
That's from <a href="http://www.george-macdonald.com/">George MacDonald</a>.  
<p>
There's something really unpopular with the idea of shame, but when you think about it, being shame<em>less</em> is a sad thing.  Our actions have weight, and sometimes we do things which we regret.  If so, shame is proper.  Of course, people are often ashamed of completely the wrong things altogether, and that's sad too.

It's a good thing that they realise that the way they treat each other is inhuman, given that they helped drive one of their colleagues to despair and to suicide.  (Greg Wilton's tragic death was provoked also by a personal relationship breakup.  There's no doubt that the ugliness of parliament was not the only factor, nor perhaps the dominant one.)  Still, the orgy of tears and regret in Parliament a couple of days ago was striking.  Yet you would have to be naive to think that this signalled any real or lasting change.  At most, it was a sign that people were coming to realise what pressures they are under, and the costs of working in the way they do.  Nothing has changed to make these pressures any less, or to take away the motivations for personal abuse and petty mindedness in parliament.  Good intentions won't cut it.

 Little did I suspect that this would be made abundantly clear <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/2000/06/item20000622024321_1.htm">so soon</a>.

     From <a href="http://www.georgemag.com/">George Magazine</a> (not a regular read, I'm afraid, but a link followed from <a href="http://www.cybereditions.com/aldaily/">Arts &amp; Letters Daily</a>) an article on cosmetic surgery.
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.georgemag.com/xp6/George/Features/beauty.xml">They are undergoing operations like liposuction, currently the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure in America but unfortunately more likely to kill you than a traffic accident.</a>
</blockquote>
Does this mean that given a random American (I'm assuming that the sample is American) they're more likely to die of liposuction than in a traffic accident, or does it mean that given that I'm out in traffic, the likelihood that I'll die that way is lower than the probability that I die of liposuction, given that I go into the surgery?  The first option is truly bad, the second is not so surprising at all.  (It's surgery, after all, and there's always a risk when you go under then knife.)  Alas, the article isn't so clear.

This comes from David Gelernter's <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gelernter/gelernter_p1.html">Manifesto</a> on the future of computing.  This has been doing the rounds on the net for the last couple of days, and I have caved in an posted a link here too, as I finally got around to reading it.  
<p>
Gelernter's obviously right when he proclaims the importance of metaphor, and he's right when he says that the file/folder metaphor employed in current user interfaces is unhelpful.  Why must files have one and only one name?  Why must I files be placed in one and only one directory? 
<p>
(This is yet <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_04_01_archive.html#129692">another</a> reason why the Newton was, and is, so revolutionary.   No files.  "Direct" manipulation of the storage.  No need to choose names for notes or folders to put things in.)

     Just a little rant before I get back into work.  
<p>
This is provoked by <a href="http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/">wetlog's pointer</a> to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_792000/792477.stm">BBC article</a> about our government's appalling <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00063.htm">propoganda</a> campaign against asylum seekers.   What's the deal here? Since when have asylum seekers been <em>queue jumpers</em> and <em>illegal immigrants</em>?  Since when have we the right to lock them up in <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00062.htm">detention centres</a> in the <a href="http://asri.cossa.csiro.au/Library/ImageLibrary/Woomera/">middle of nowhere</a>?
<p>
The <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00062.htm">breakouts</a> in these detention centres might just have something to do with the fact that we treat these people badly.  It's a simple matter to do the obvious background security checks first, then release people into the community while the rest of their case is assessed.  But no, we lock them up in prison conditions for the whole time.  And we treat them as illegal immigrants, when there are <a href="http://www.unhcr.ch/refworld/refworld/legal/instrume/asylum/1951eng.htm">international conventions</a> explaining how to treat refugees.  We're not exactly up to <em>best practice</em> here.  (This is one consequence of living in a country which is still ambivalent about immigrants in general.  It probably has something to do with the fact that most of us are immigrant stock ourselves: we know how easy it was to displace the original people of this land, and we are rather frightened that it might happen to us.)
<p>
Anyway, buried in one <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media00/r00062.htm">ministerial press release</a> I find the damning number.  We've only seen <em>4000</em> "illegal entries" in the last year!  (The UNHCR <a href="http://www.unhcr.ch/world/asia/australi.htm">figures</a> for Australia say we're housing about 61,000</a> refugees in total at present.)  And this government complains about the <em>flood</em> of illegals?  Let's try housing the <a href="http://www.unhcr.ch/world/afri/sudan.htm">392,000</a> housed by Sudan in 1998?  I will be watching with interest to see the UNHCR <a href="http://www.unhcr.ch/world/asia/australi.htm">assessment</a> of Australia's performance in 2000.  Our mediocre performance before 2000 has given us good standing in the global community.  I cannot imagine that this current turn of rhetoric, and behaviour, bodes well for the future.
<p>
More refugee links are available at the excellent <a href="http://www.unhcr.ch/">UNHCR site</a>.

     Here's a <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~lnewton/music/JarrettSketch.html"><em>great</em> little biography of Keith Jarrett</a>.  I've listened to the K&amp;ouml;ln concert through a few times, and it strikes me as the most <em>direct</em> jazz performance I've heard.  Thinking about it, it's the only solo jazz performance I've heard, and this probably has something to do with it.

I can tell that this is not just a piano playing.  He is a <em>person</em> playing a piano.  And playing it <em>very</em> well.

     Hmmm.  A <a href="http://www.cyc.com/employment.html">job</a> if I ever want to leave academia?  OK, it's not moving <em>very</em> far, intellectually speaking.

(I think that the <a href="http://www.cyc.com/">Cyc</a> project, understood as a means to Artificial Intelligence, is deeply flawed, but that's a view based on a reasonably swift reading of what they're doing.

second largest theatre on campus, and he spoke clearly and movingly about
the current reconciliation process: about how he was hesitant about it
all at the start (as it seemed to put the onus on aborigines to reconcile
themselves to the current situation, more than we as a nation reconciling
ourselves with our wronged brothers and sisters), how he's been encouraged
to see what's happening on the ground in places like Kempsie, and Mackay,
how he was moved to see the march on the bridge, and the outpourings of
interest and concern in local communities everywhere over Australia, and
how he thinks that the process will continue, even given the recalcitrance
of our political masters at a Federal level.
<p>
Then he spoke about possibilities for future work: he spoke about the 
possibility of a treaty or some other document.  This was when it clicked
for me a little more.  He explained about the legal lacuna in our own
situation.  We agree that the aborigines had sovereignty over the continent
before 1788, we agree that the Australian state has sovereignty now, and
we agree that the only ways to transfer sovereignty are conquest or 
treaty.  We deny that there was a conquest.  We do not have a treaty.
How did this transfer of rights happen?  So, treaties are on the 
agenda.  This was his only disappointment about the current work
of the reconciliation council.  He described how they were constituted
to do the groundwork for a community-wide discussion about a treaty,
and they haven't done this.  (No doubt they were so constituted because
the Labor government didn't want to think about it themselves, and 
the transition to the Conservatives has spooked them badly, but still.)
<p>
Anyway, the talk was great, the discussion was encouraging, and I left
reassured that the discussion will continue, and that there is a 
groundswell of opinion which will mean that we will eventually get this
right.  Or at least, a lot righter than it is at present.
<p>
Only time will tell if my reassurance is justified.

     Let me wade in where angels fear to tread.  <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/2000_06_01_archive.html">Russ Young has problems</a> with the line of reasoning found <a href="http://www.barbelith.com/2000_05_28_xeno.htm#286340">here</a> in an open letter to Dr. Laura, about her condemnation of homosexuality.
<p>
Not wanting to judge at all in this debate, I  just want to point out that Russ's judgement that the open letter is a logical fallacy is completely mistaken.  He misreads the argument as a simple appeal against what he calls "biblical authority".  It needn't be read in that way at all.  The letter, which simply asks Dr. Laura to apply lots of other interesting commands from the Torah, does not fail on matters of relevance.  If you wish to judge the argument on matters of validity, it seems that what's going on is something like <em>this</em>:
<blockquote>
If regulations in Torah are applicable today, we ought do <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em> and <em>Z</em>.<br>
It's not the case that we ought do  <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em> and <em>Z</em>. <br>(In fact, <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em> and <em>Z</em> seem quite silly, really.)<br>
Therefore, regulations in Torah are not applicable today.
</blockquote>
Now, if your reasons against homosexuality are found in  the regulations Torah, then this argument has bite.  It certainly seems relevant to me.  (It's not as fun phrased in this way, but still, it was criticised on <em>logical</em> grounds, and this is an occupational hazard when it comes to logic.)   Note too, that it's not an argument against scriptural authority <em>per se</em>.  It's a question about the applicability of laws in Torah.  
<p>
Of <em>course</em> this isn't the end of the story, or of the argument.  But that, I'll leave to others.
<p>
Back to your previously scheduled programming.

There's absolutely no question that <em>we</em> knew that what we were doing in invading this country was wrong.  There was no treaty, there was no settlement, there was no just compact with the indigenous people of this land.  The moral relativism of our Prime Minister, in asserting that we cannot judge our forebears because the standards were different in their days, is not only rather surprising for a conservative like him, but is put to shame by the 'whispering in our hearts' that Reynolds uncovers.  If you're interested in immigrant/indigenous relations, read this book!

     The <a href="http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/monads.htm">Monads</a> come up with such musical gems as  <em>Meinongian Babe Sitting in a Bar</em> with lines like: 
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/meinongi.htm">There's an infinity of possible worlds<br>
So why can't you be in one with me?<br>
So why can't you be in one with me?

You can download lots of philosophical songs in their MP3 glory <a href="http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/sad.htm">here</a>.
<p>
The chorus of <a href="http://www3.cybercities.com/m/monads/anodeto.htm">An Ode to Modus Ponens</a> is quite compelling.  I never thought that you could sing
<blockquote>
If P, then Q<br>
Not Q<br>
Not P
</blockquote>
so touchingly.  Wow.  If <a href="http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html">JC</a> keeps sending me links this good, I'll give up browsing myself and just follow him around.

     <a href="http://www.jbum.com/jbum/public_opinion.html">This</a> is one way to do research.  Apparently pluralsim beats monism by roughly <a href="http://www.jbum.com/jbum/public_opinion.html">25 to 8</a>.

     Would you eat <a href="">synthetic meat</a>?
<p>
Here's a snippet from the article
<blockquote>
Quietly, researchers are working on what may be the greatest alteration in the food chain since the first time a big fish swallowed a little fish--a system in which steaks, chops, and poultry are obtained without raising or killing animals.
</blockquote>
I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat very much meat.  (I rarely cook with any meat.)  My two main objections to high meat consumption are health concerns and the over-intensive agricultural process used in order to get the food to the person.  It's just not sustainable to regularly feed over 5 billion people lots of hunks of cow, pig and chicken.  It seems like <em>this</em> process is even worse, adding another layer of high-tech heavy industry to the process.  Will we ever learn to <a href="http://givequick.org/gt/amazon/1875989463/">touch this earth lightly</a> again?

     Well, for what it's worth, I have <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/misc/faithandlogic.html">written up</a>
what I thought of the <a href="http://www.fpcr.org/blue_banner_articles/WCF_Logic.htm">article</a> that <a href="http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html">JC</a> pointed me to.  I'm not really happy with what I've written so far.  It describes why I don't like the article, and what's wrong with it, but it doesn't say very much positive at all.  I'd like to say something positive, but for that, I'll need to think some more.
<p>
I'd appreciate any comments you have, but be warned, the prose is pretty thick, and you need an interest in both theology and logic to get something out of it.
<p>
I'll now return you to your previously scheduled programming.

     The NY Times gives us a little <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/053000sci-physics-light.html">more information</a> on the faster than light caper I mentioned <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log/2000_05_01_archive.html#282507">yesterday</a>.

Oh for an idea of what physicists <em>mean</em> by the phrase "sending information."
