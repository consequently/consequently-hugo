<h1>Logic Text Chapter 2 Solutions</h1></div><div class="content browse"><h2>Chapter 2: Connectives and Argument Forms</h2><h3>Solutions</h3><p><i>Question {2.1}</i></p><p>1. Greg is in town.</p><p>2. Fred is very smart.</p><p>3. Minh is a bad student </p><p>4. Every car is fuel efficient.</p><p>5. That car is either red or a diesel. (This is a tricky one. The answer is not &#x201c;That car is both red and a diesel.&#x201d; Do you understand why? )</p><p><i>Question {2.2}</i></p><p>1. It is -5 degrees. The clouds are grey.</p><p>2. He was tired. He wanted to keep going.</p><p>3. The waves were breaking. The surf was low.</p><p>4. There was a strike. The power was not cut.</p><p>5. Fred is not a mechanic. Jack is not a mechanic.</p><p><i>Question {2.3}</i></p><p>1. Eric is there. Yukiko is there.</p><p>2. The car is white. The car is yellow.</p><p>3. Brian is doing a Ph.D.</p><p>Brian is doing a Masters degree.</p><p>4. It rains. It doesn&#x2019;t rain.</p><p>5. I&#x2019;ll have coffee. I&#x2019;ll have tea.</p><p><i>Question {2.4}</i></p><p>1. It is raining. I&#x2019;ll walk home.</p><p>2. You look outside. (Perhaps better: You will look outside, to match the consequent.) You&#x2019;ll see the nice garden I planted.</p><p>3. I&#x2019;m tired. I don&#x2019;t do my logic well.</p><p>4. I do logic well. I&#x2019;m awake. (Be careful with &#x201c;only if"s.)</p><p>5. I&#x2019;m awake. I do logic well.</p><p>6. You work hard. You will pass.</p><p>7. The world&#x2019;s future will be assured. We get rid of nuclear weapons.</p><p>8. We get rid of nuclear weapons. The world&#x2019;s future will be assured.</p><p>9. Oswald didn&#x2019;t shoot Kennedy. Someone else did shoot Kennedy.</p><p>10. Oswald didn&#x2019;t shoot Kennedy. Someone else did shoot Kennedy. (This is a tricky one. &#x201c;Oswald hadn&#x2019;t shot Kennedy&#x201d; is not a sentence, so it can&#x2019;t be an antecedent, given our definition. Most people think that 9 and 10 have the same antecedent and consequent, but the conditional combines them slightly differently. In the first case we wonder what happens if Oswald isn&#x2019;t Kennedy&#x2019;s assassin. In the second, we assume that Oswald was Kennedy&#x2019;s assassin and wonder how things would have been had he not shot Kennedy.)</p><p><i>Question {2.5}</i></p><p>1. Conditional of &#x201c;Christine is happy&#x201d; and &#x201c;She is not thinking about her thesis&#x201d;. The second proposition here is a negation of &#x201c;she is thinking about her thesis.&#x201d;</p><p>2. Negation of &#x201c;I know if she&#x2019;s coming to the party&#x201d;, and this is not a conditional. (If it were, what would be the antecedent and consequent?)</p><p>3. Conditional with antecedent of &#x201c;Theodore is enrolled in PHIL134, and he passes&#x201d; and consequent &#x201c;He can go on to do advanced logic subjects.&#x201d; The antecedent is a conjunction of &#x201c;Theodore is enrolled in PHIL134&#x201d; and &#x201c;Theodore passes PHIL134&#x201d;.</p><p>4. Conditional with antecedent &#x201c;Theodore isn&#x2019;t enrolled in PHIL134, or he doesn&#x2019;t pass&#x201d; (the &#x201c;if&#x201d; in there can be taken out) and consequent &#x201c;Theodore cannot go on to do advanced logic subjects&#x201d;. The antecedent is a disjunction of &#x201c;Theodore isn&#x2019;t enrolled in PHIL134&#x201d; (which is in turn, the negation of &#x201c;Theodore is enrolled in PHIL134&#x201d;) and of &#x201c;Theodore doesn&#x2019;t pass PHIL134&#x201d; (which is in turn the negation of &#x201c;Theodore does pass PHIL134&#x201d;). The consequent, which is, remember, &#x201c;Theodore cannot go on to do advanced logic subjects&#x201d;, is the negation of &#x201c;Theodore can go on to do advanced logic subjects&#x201d;. Phew!</p><p>5. This is the conjunction of &#x201c;I believe that you are either going to leave the party early or make a scene&#x201d; and &#x201c;You know that you are either going to leave the party early or make a scene&#x201d;. These both don&#x2019;t go any further. The first is an &#x201c;I believe that &#x2026;&#x201d; statement. This is not a disjunction of &#x201c;I believe that you are going to leave the party early&#x201d; and &#x201c;I believe that you are going to make a scene&#x201d;, as I might not believe either disjunct of the disjunction, while still believing the whole disjunction. Same goes for the other conjunct about knowledge.</p><p><i>Question {2.6}</i></p><p>1. Yukiko is not a linguist.</p><p>2. Yukiko is not a linguist or Pavlos is a logician.</p><p>3. Yukiko is not a linguist if and only if Christine is a lawyer.</p><p>4. If Yukiko is a linguist, then if Christine is a lawyer, Pavlos is a logician.</p><p>5. If Yukiko is a linguist and Pavlos is not a logician then Christine is a lawyer.</p><p>6. Yukiko is a linguist and Christine is a lawyer.</p><p>7. It&#x2019;s not the case that both Yukiko is a linguist and Pavlos is a logician.</p><p>8. It&#x2019;s not the case that Yukiko is a linguist if and only if Christine is a lawyer.</p><p>9. It&#x2019;s not the case that Christine is not a lawyer.</p><p>10. Yukiko is a linguist if and only if either Christine is a lawyer or Pavlos is not a logician.</p><p>11. Yukiko is a linguist or Christine is a lawyer.</p><p>12. Yukiko is a linguist if and only if Pavlos is a logician.</p><p>13. If Yukiko is a linguist, Christine is a lawyer.</p><p>14. If Yukiko is a linguist only if Christine is a lawyer, then Pavlos is a logician.</p><p>15. I can&#x2019;t get a good English translation for this. Can you?</p><p><i>Question {2.7}</i></p><p>1. ~ <i>c</i></p><p>2. <i>y</i> &amp; <i>p</i></p><p>3. <i>p</i> &#x2283; <i>y</i></p><p>4. <i>p</i> &#x2228; ~ <i>y</i></p><p>5. ~(<i>p</i> &amp; <i>c</i>)</p><p>6. <i>y</i> &#x2283; (<i>p</i> &amp; ~ <i>c</i>)</p><p>7. (<i>y</i> &#x2228; ~ <i>p</i>) &#x2283; <i>c</i></p><p>8. <i>y</i> &#x2261; (<i>p</i> &#x2228; ~ <i>c</i>)</p><p>9. <i>p</i> &#x2228; (<i>y</i> &#x2283; <i>c</i>)</p><p>10. (<i>p</i> &#x2228; <i>y</i>) &#x2283; <i>c</i></p><p><i>Question {2.8}</i></p><p>1, 4, 6, 9 and 10 are well-formed, the rest are not.</p></div>
