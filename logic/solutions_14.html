<div class="content browse"><h2>Chapter 14: What is a Predicate?</h2><h3>Basic</h3><p><i>Question {14.1}</i></p><p>I think that the narrow predications appear in numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7.</p><p>For 2, Superman might be famous for running very fast, but Clark Kent isn&#x2019;t.</p><p>For 6, I might be sick and tired of that guy who&#x2019;s been emailing me a lot, but I might not be sick and tired of you, even though you are that person.</p><p>For 8, what I can distinguish depends on my capacity for description or whatever. I might be able to tell Superman apart from Jimmy Olsen (a photographer for the Daily Planet), but not Clark Kent from Jimmy Olsen.</p><p>For 9, I might know Superman but not Clark Kent.</p><p><i>Question {14.2}</i></p><p>I might think that something bit me, without there being something such that I think that it bit me. I might think I&#x2019;ve been bitten, but I might not know what bit me. </p></div>
