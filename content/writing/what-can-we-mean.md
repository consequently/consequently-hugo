Last century, Michael Dummett argued that the principles of 
intuitionistic logic are semantically neutral, and that classical logic
involves a distinctive commitment to realism. The ensuing debate over realism
and anti-realism and intuitionistic logic has now receded from view. The
situation is reversed in mathematics: constructive reasoning has become more
popular in the 21st century with the rise of proof assistants based on
constructive type theory. In this paper, I revisit Dummett’s concerns in the
light of these developments, arguing that both constructive and classical
reasoning are recognisable and coherent assertoric and inferential practices.
