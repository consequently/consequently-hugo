<i>Substructural logics</i> are non-classical logics <i>weaker</i> than classical logic, notable for the absence of <i>structural rules</i> present in classical logic. These logics are motivated by considerations from philosophy (relevant logics), linguistics (the Lambek calculus) and computing (linear logic). In addition, techniques from substructural logics are useful in the study of traditional logics such as classical and intuitionistic logic. This article provides an overview of the field of substructural logic.
