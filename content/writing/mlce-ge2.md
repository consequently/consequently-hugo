In this paper, I defend *contingentism*, the natural idea that some things exist
contingently. Had my parents not met, I would not have existed. It is perhaps
surprising that an everyday idea like contingentism needs defence, but natural
reasoning principles concerning possibility and necessity on the one hand, and
the existential and universal quantifiers on the other, have led some to
*necessitism*, the alternate view, that everything that exists, exists neces-
sarily. 

Almost all recent work on the semantics of possibility, necessity and the
quantifiers---and its metaphysics---makes essential use of possible worlds
models. These models have proved useful for analysing the formal and structural
properties of modal logics, but it is less clear that these models help fix the
meaning of our modal vocabulary, given that we have no grasp of what counts as
a possible world independent of our grasp of what counts as possible. In this
paper, I develop an alternate *inferentialist* semantics for the modal and
quantificational vocabulary, not as a rival to possible worlds models, but as
an explanation of how it is that the concepts we do employ can be modelled
using possible worlds. I then use this inferentialist semantics to clarify the
contingentistâ€™s commitments, and offer answers to necessitist objections.
