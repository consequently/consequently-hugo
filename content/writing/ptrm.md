This is my next book-length writing project.  I am writing a book which aims to do these things:</p>
<ol>
<li /> Be a useable introduction to philosophical logic, accessible to someone who's done only an introductory course in logic, covering at least some model theory and proof theory of propositional logic, and maybe a little bit of predicate logic.
<li /> Be a user-friendly, pedagogically useful and philosophically motivated presentation of cut-elimination, normalisation and conservative extension, both (a) why they're important to semantics and (b) how to actually <em>prove</em> them.  (I don't think there are any books like this currently available, but I'd be happy to be shown wrong.)
<li /> Present the duality between model theory and proof theory in a philosophically illuminating and clear fashion.
<li /> And then apply these results to issues concerning meaning, epistemology and metaphysics, including issues of logical consequence and rationality, the problem of absolute generality, and the status of modality.
</ol>
Are you interested in getting a look at the draft? The best way to do that is to come to [this symposium](http://ba-logic.com/workshops/symposium-restall/) in Buenos Aires in July 2018, where we'll be discussing it.
