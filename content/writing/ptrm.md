This is my next book-length writing project.  I am writing a book which aims to do these things:</p>
<ol>
<li /> Be a useable introduction to philosophical logic, accessible to someone who's done only an intro course in logic, covering at least some model theory and proof theory of propositional logic, and maybe predicate logic.
<li /> Be a user-friendly, pedagogically useful and philosophically motivated presentation of cut-elimination, normalisation and conservative extension, both (a) why they're important to meaning theory and (b) how to actually <em>prove</em> them.  (I don't think there are any books like this available, but I'd be happy to be shown wrong.)
<li /> Present the duality between model theory and proof theory in a philosophically illuminating fashion.
<li /> And then apply these results to philosophical issues concerning meaning, epistemology and metaphysics, around logical consequence and rationality, the problem of absolute generality, and the status of modality.
</ol>
