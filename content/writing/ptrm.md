This is my next book-length writing project.  I am writing a book which aims to do these things:</p>
<ol>
<li> Be a useable introduction to philosophical logic, accessible to someone who's done only an introductory course in logic, covering at least some model theory and proof theory of propositional logic, and maybe a little bit of predicate logic.
<li> Be a user-friendly, pedagogically useful and philosophically motivated presentation of cut-elimination, normalisation and conservative extension, both (a) why they're important to semantics and (b) how to actually <em>prove</em> them.  (I don't think there are any books like this currently available, but I'd be happy to be shown wrong.)
<li> Present the duality between model theory and proof theory in a philosophically illuminating and clear fashion.
<li> And then apply these results to issues concerning meaning, epistemology and metaphysics, including issues of logical consequence and rationality, the problem of absolute generality, and the status of modality.
</ol>

<p>Here is an outline of the manuscript, showing how the parts hold together. At least so far &mdash; I'm still writing the third part.</p>

</figure>
The book is in three parts.
<ol>
	<li> *Tools*: in which core concepts from proof theory are introduced.
	<li> *The Core Argument*: in which I motivate <em>defining rules</em>, and show how they answer Arthur Prior's challenge concerning when an inference rule defines a logical concept.
	<li> *Insights*: in which we see consequences for logic and language, epistemology and metaphysics, etc.
</ol>


The book draft was discussed at [this symposium](http://ba-logic.com/workshops/symposium-restall/) in Buenos Aires in July 2018. I'm currently finalising the last section of the book, and updating the whole manuscript based on the feedback I got there from colleagues.
