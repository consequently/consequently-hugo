In this paper, I motivate a cut free sequent calculus for classical logic with first order quantification, allowing for singular terms free of existential import. Along the way, I motivate a criterion for rules designed to answer Prior's question about what distinguishes rules for logical concepts, like &lsquo;conjunction&rsquo; from apparently similar rules for putative concepts like &lsquo;tonk&rsquo;, and I show that the rules for the quantifiers&mdash;and the existence predicate&mdash;satisfy that condition.
