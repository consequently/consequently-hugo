We present a new frame semantics for positive relevant and substructural propositional logics. This frame semantics is both a generalization of Routley&ndash;Meyer ternary frames and a simplification of them. The key innovation of this semantics is the use of a single accessibility relation to relate collections of points to points.  Different logics are modeled by varying the kinds of collections used: they can be sets, multisets, lists or trees. We show that collection frames on trees are sound and complete for the basic positive substructural logic B<sup>+</sup>, that collection frames on multisets are sound and complete for RW<sup>+</sup> (the relevant logic R<sup>+</sup>, without contraction, or equivalently, positive multiplicative and additive linear logic with distribution for the additive connectives), and that collection frames on sets are sound for the positive relevant logic R<sup>+</sup>. (The completeness of set frames for R<sup>+</sup> is, currently, an open question.)
