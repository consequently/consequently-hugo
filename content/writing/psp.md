In this essay, I examine the significance of a range of paradoxes (such as
semantic, set-theoretic, sorites paradoxes) for a number of different philosophical
issues concerning logic, including the choice of a logical system, the epistemology
of logic, and the boundary–if there is one–between logical and non-logical concepts. Along the way, I consider the difference between revisionary logical proposals motivated by expanding the range of *models* (say, by moving from two-valued to three-valued valuations), and those motivated by restricting the structure of *proofs* (say, by restricting the application of the structural rules of *contraction* or *Cut*). 

I also argue that whether one could take a  *conservative* or *revisionary* approach to logical principles in the light of the paradoxes is orthogonal to the question of whether to be an *exceptionalist* or an *anti-exceptionalist* about logic, since all four combinations these positions have been staked out in recent work: anti-exceptionalist conservative (Tim Williamson) and anti-exceptionalist revisionist (Graham Priest), exceptionalist conservative (Per Martin-Löf), exceptionalist revisionist (Uwe Petersen).
