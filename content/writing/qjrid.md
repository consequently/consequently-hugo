In this paper, I examine connections between the speech acts of assertion, 
denial, polar questions and justification requests, and the common ground. 
When we pay attention to the structure of norms governing polar  questions, 
we can clarify the distinction between strong and weak denial, together with 
the parallel distinction between strong and weak assertion, and the distinct 
way that these speech acts interact with the common ground. In addition, 
once we pay attention to the distinct norms concerning justification requests, 
we can give a distinctive answer to Carrollâ€™s puzzle concerning the force 
of the logical must, and the sense in which certain rules for logical 
concepts can indeed count as definitions.


This paper is to appear in a <em>Synthese</em> edited collection on non-assertoric speech acts.
