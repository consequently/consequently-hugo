In this paper, I show how to incorporate insights from the model-theoretic semantics for negation (insights due the late J. Michael Dunn, among others, in his paper "Star and Perp: Two Treatments of Negation"), into a *proof*-first understanding of the semantics of negation. I then discuss the how a logical pluralist may understand the underlying accounts of proofs and their significance.
