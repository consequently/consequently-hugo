Martin Hägglund’s _This Life_ is an important treatise on metaphysics, philosophical
anthropology, and political philosophy. It is also a critique of religious orientations to the
world. In this paper, I reflect on Hägglund’s account of value and our finitude, and on his criticism of
Martin Luther King, Jr’s political theology. According to Hägglund, King’s appeal to _God_ when
calling for justice should be replaced by an appeal to our communal norms. To defer to God is
at best a colourful way of depicting our own commitments. At worst, it has no determinate
content, and it threatens to absolve us of making justice here and now.

I will show that while Hägglund’s account is a salutary corrective to a pervasive kind of bad faith, 
this criticism misses its target. Any identification of God’s justice with our communal norms is to
mischaracterise concepts like these. They are _ideals_ that direct our attention outside ourselves,
in the same way that love orients us toward an _other_. Hägglund’s account points us to the
crucial concept of _dependence_, and that once we understand this better, we will see that a
religious orientation toward the infinite and secular faith are compatible.
