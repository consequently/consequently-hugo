*Abstract*: I show that the cut-free proof terms defined in my paper "[Proof Terms for Classical Derivations](http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/)" form a well-behaved category. The talk is intended to be accessible enough for those who don't know any category theory to follow along. I show that the category is not Cartesian -- and that we'd be wrong to expect to be.  It has no products or coproducts, nor any initial or final objects.  Nonetheless, it is quite well behaved. 

I show that the term category is *star autonomous* (so it fits well within the family of categories for multiplicative linear logic), with internal *monoids* and *comonoids* taking care of weakening and contraction. The category is enriched in the category of semilattices, as proofs are closed under the *blend* rule (also called "mix" in the literature). 

This is a talk presented at the [Melbourne Logic Seminar](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/logic-seminar/).
