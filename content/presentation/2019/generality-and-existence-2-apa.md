*Abstract*:  In this talk, I motivate and define a cut free sequent calculus for first order modal predicate logics, allowing for singular terms free of existential import. I show that the *cut* rule is admissible in the cut-free calculus, and explore the relationship between contingent ‘world-bound’ quantifiers and possibilist ‘world-undbound’ quantifiers in the system.

* This is a talk for the Association for Symbolic Logic at the Central Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association, at Denver, Colorado.
