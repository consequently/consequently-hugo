*Abstract*:  In this talk I present a new frame semantics for positive substructural and relevant propositional logics. This frame semantics is both a *generalisation* of Routleyâ€“Meyer ternary frames and a *simplification* of them. The key innovation is the use of a single accessibility relation to relate collections of points to points. Different logics are modelled by varying the kinds of collections featuring in the relation: for example, they can be sets, multisets, lists or trees.  In this talk I will focus on multiset frames, which are sound and complete for the logic RW+ (positive multiplicative and additive linear logic with distribution for the additive connectives, or equivalently, the relevant logic R+ without contraction). 

This is joint work with Shawn Standefer.
