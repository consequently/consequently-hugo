*Abstract*: In this talk, I reflect on the role of worlds–*possible* worlds and *impossible* worlds—both in the semantics of various kinds of languages and logics, and in broader issues in metaphysics. I will argue that, given very modest assumptions concerning the role of worlds in semantics, that any defender of possible worlds in such a role should be equally comfortable with *impossible* worlds.

However, this argument for impossible worlds does not transfer straightforwardly to *logically* impossible worlds. So, in the second part of the talk I will consider what we might say, for (or against) properly logically impossible worlds. 

* The talk is a presentation at the Arch&eacute; Logic and Metaphysics Seminar, University of St Andrews.
