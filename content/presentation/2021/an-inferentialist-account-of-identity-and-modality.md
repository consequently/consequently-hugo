*Abstract*: In this talk I will show how *defining rules* in a hypersequent setting can give a uniform proof-theoretic semantics of identity and modality, allowing -- equally naturally -- for (1) modal operators for which identity statements are *necessary* (if true), and (2) modal operators for which identity statements can be *contingently* true.


* The talk is an online presentation for the [ERC EXPRESS Project](https://inferentialexpressivism.com/seminar/) in Amsterdam, and the [PHILMATH Seminar](https://www.ihpst.cnrs.fr/en/activites/seminaires/seminaire-philmath-2019-2020-0) in Paris.
