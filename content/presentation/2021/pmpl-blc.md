*Abstract*: In this talk, I will draw out three different ways that soundness and completeness&mdash;and the relationship between proofs and models&mdash;can teach us in something about classical propositional logic, the semantics of modal logic, and the metaphysics of quantified modal logic.
 
* The talk is an online presentation for the [British Logic Colloqium](https://blc-logic.org/blc-meetings/). 

* The [slides for the talk are available here](https://consequently.org/slides/pmpl-blc.pdf).
