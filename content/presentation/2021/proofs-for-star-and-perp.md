*Abstract*: In this talk, I show how to incorporate insights from the model-theoretic semantics for negation (insights due the late J. Michael Dunn, among others), into a properly proof-theoretic understanding of the semantics of negation. I then discuss the different ways a logical pluralist may understand the underlying accounts of proofs and their significance. 

* The talk is a presentation at the Current Debates in the Philosophy of Logic Seminar, [European Network for the Philosophy of Logic](https://euphilo.net/events/).
