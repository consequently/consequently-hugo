*Abstract*: In this talk, I will place contemporary research in philosophical logic in a wider historical and philosophical context, showing how recent work in logic connects to the rivalry between *Platonism* and *Nominalism*, or *realism* and *anti-realism* in metaphysics, and between *representationalism* and *inferentialism* in the the philosophy of language. Along the way, I will touch on the contemporary resurgence of interest in Carnap's logical positivism, and Robert Brandom's turn toward Hegel.
