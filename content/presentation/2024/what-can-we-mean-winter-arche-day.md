*Abstract*: What does the semantically anti-realist revisionary programme of
Michael Dummett have to do with contemporary work on proof assistants? What are
mathematicians doing when they encode their proofs in these proof assistants,
based on constructive type theory? What does all this have to do with the(?)
norms of assertion? (And are these norms of assertion relative or absolute,
anyway?) Can I explain all of this, coherently, to a general audience of philosophers
in five minutes?

The answer to the last of these questions is _almost certainly no_, but I'm going to
give it a red hot go.


* This talk is a five-minute lightning presentation at the [Winter All-Arché Research Day](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/event/all-arche-research-day-2/).

* A (one page) handout [is here](/handouts/what-can-we-mean-winter-arche-day-handout.pdf).
