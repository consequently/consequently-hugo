*Abstract*: When I use a calculator to tell me that 245 × 46 = 11,270, I learn
something that I didn’t know before, even though calculators don’t have any
beliefs or knowledge. Even small children know how to count things, and it is
through our own capacity to enumerate and count things that we learn basic
arithmetic. Calculators do not count things in any sense like we do, yet we can
use them to learn arithmetic facts.

Calculators are one a simple example of the growing phenomenon of meaning at
the boundary between humans and machines. In this talk I’ll draw out some
lessons from recent work using computers to augment human reasoning to help us
clarify what we are doing when we’re making claims about the world and trying
to reason about them.


* This talk is a presentation at the University of St Andrews PhilSoc (the undergraduate Philosophy Student Society).
