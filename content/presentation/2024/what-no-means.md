*Abstract*: In this 5 minute lightning talk, I will introduce the difference between strong and weak denial, and use it to clarify the claims I made in “[Multiple Conclusions](https://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/)” about the connection between assertion, denial and logical consequence.


* The talk is a presentation at the [2024 Arché Day](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/event/all-arche-research-day/).

* The [handout for the talk is available here](/handouts/what-no-does.pdf).
