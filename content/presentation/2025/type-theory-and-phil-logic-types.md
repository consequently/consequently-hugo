*Abstract*: 
Contemporary type theorists share interests and concerns with philosophical
logicians. This isn’t surprising, since Per Martin-Löf is (among other things)
a philosopher, and type theory was born in philosophy. Although type theory has
come into its own in computer science—and, more recently, in mathematics with
the rise of assistants—the connections between type theory
and philosophical logic go beyond Martin-Löf’s original motivations. There are
many fresh points of contact with active research areas in philosophical logic.
In the interest of fostering communication between these different traditions,
I will sketch some of these connections, including recent work on modal and 
substructural logics; the interactions between intensionality, equality and 
identity; the relationship between constructive and classical logic; theories
of propositions and speech acts; and the relationship between purely formal and 
applied logic and type theory.
