In October, I will be giving the *[2025 Wendy Huang Lectures](https://consequently.org/p/whl)*
at the invitation of the Taiwan Association for Logic,
Methodology and Philosophy of Science, at NTU Taiwan, in Taipei.
In preparation for those lectures, I'm trying out the ideas in three 
sessions in the Metpahysics and Logic Group at Arché. The three talks 
are:

1. Inferentialism for Everyone ([handout](/handouts/whl-a-1.pdf))
> I aim to give an opinionated introduction to inferentialist
> semantics, giving an account about what is so distinctive about
> logic, insofar as logical notions have a grip on whatever can be
> _said_ or _thought_. In doing this, I aim to clarify the connections
> between logic and _semantics_, the theory of meaning.
2. Existence &amp; Modality
> In the second lecture, I will show how the inferentialist semantics, introduced in Lecture 1, applies to issues of predication, quantification and modality, and thereby provides some distinctive insight into `possible worlds' models for quantified modal logics.
3. Foundations for Truth-Conditional Semantics
> Finally, I show how we might relate inferentialist semantics to truth-conditional accounts of meaning for natural languages.
