In October, I will be giving the *2025 Wendy Huang Lectures*
at the invitation of the Taiwan Association for Logic,
Methodology and Philosophy of Science, at NTU Taiwan, in Taipei.
In preparation for those lectures, I'm trying out the ideas in three 
sessions in the Metpahysics and Logic Group at Arché. The three talks 
are:

1. Inferentialism for Everyone ([handout](/handouts/whl-a-1.pdf))
2. Existence &amp; Modality
3. Foundations for Truth-Conditional Semantics
