I will be giving the *[2025 Wendy Huang Lectures](https://philo.ntu.edu.tw/web/announcement/announcement_in.jsp?np_id=NP1760664807989)*
at the invitation of the Taiwan Association for Logic,
Methodology and Philosophy of Science, at National Taiwan University, in
Taipei, from October 21 to 23. The third lecture will also be a keynote
presentation at the [Taiwan Philosophical Logic Colloquium](https://sites.google.com/view/tplc-2025/home).
The three talks 
are:

1. <b>Inferentialism for Everyone</b> Tuesday October 21 &bull; ([handout](/handouts/whl-h-1.pdf))
> I aim to give an opinionated introduction to inferentialist
> semantics, giving an account about what is so distinctive about
> logic, insofar as logical notions have a grip on whatever can be
> _said_ or _thought_. In doing this, I aim to clarify the connections
> between logic and _semantics_, the theory of meaning.
2. <b>Existence &amp; Modality</b> (Wednesday October 22) &bull; ([handout](/handouts/whl-h-2.pdf))
> In the second lecture, I will show how the inferentialist
> semantics, introduced in Lecture 1, applies to issues of
> predication, quantification and modality, and thereby provides
> some distinctive insight into ‘possible worlds’ models for
> quantified modal logics.
3. <b>Foundations for Truth-Conditional Semantics</b> (Thursday October 23) &bull; ([handout](/handouts/whl-h-3.pdf))
> Finally, I show how we might relate inferentialist semantics to truth-conditional accounts of meaning for natural languages.
