*Abstract*: 
Twenty-first century mathematics has seen the rise of the proof assistant, and
mathematical practice has changed significantly with the rise of these new
tools. One consequence of this change, for the philosopher of mathematics, is
the wider adoption in mathematics of intuitionistic logic, since many
mathematicians now rush to formalise results in the language of constructive
type theory (the framework underlying popular proof assistants such as *Agda* and
*Lean*). In this talk, I will describe this relatively modern
phenomenon, and relate it to considerations central to philosophical
discussions in the twentieth century, about how to provide a neutral framework
for addressing questions in metaphysics. The contemporary use of proof
assistants can provide a useful new angle on these longstanding questions, not
only about how we can come to know the truths of mathematics, but also for the
very content of whatever we can think and say.
