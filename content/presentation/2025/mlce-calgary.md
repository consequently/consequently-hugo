*Abstract*: 
In this talk, I will defend *contingentism*, the idea that some things exist
contingently. It might be surprising that this needs defence, but natural
reasoning principles concerning possibility and necessity on the one hand, and
the existential and universal quantifiers on the other, have led some to
_necessitism_, the view that everything that exists, exists necessarily.

Almost all recent work on modal semantics makes essential use of possible
worlds models. These models have proved useful for analysing the structural
properties of modal logics, but it is less clear that they fix the meaning of
our modal vocabulary, given that we have no grasp of what counts as a possible
world, independent of our grasp of what counts as possible. In this talk, I
describe an  inferentialist semantics for modal and quantificational
vocabulary, not as a rival to possible worlds models, but as an explanation of
how the concepts we do employ can be modelled using possible worlds. I then use
this inferentialist semantics to clarify the contingentistâ€™s commitments, and
offer answers to necessitist objections.
