This is a longer, more relaxed and interactive version of the talk &ldquo;Why
Logic Matters for Philosophy, and why Philosophy Matters for Logic&rdquo; that
I [first gave](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/wlmfp-wpmfl-i/) as a
part of the [Inaugural Lecture
Showcase](https://events.st-andrews.ac.uk/events/inaugural-lecture-showcase-philosophy/)
of the Philosophy Department.
