*Abstract*: 
Starting with the his much-discussed 2006 paper &ldquo;Must Do Better,&rsquo;
Timothy Williamson has offered a series of methodological reflections and
recommendations for philosophers. Good philosophy, for Williamson, (1) prefers
precision and rigour to depth and profundity, (2) where possible, it avails
itself of formal modelling, so as to not only prescribe definitions or analyses
of concepts, but make a range of predictions that can be tested, (3) embraces
the constraints of connections to other disciplines and to a range of
scientific norms. 

While there is much to appreciate in Williamson&rsquo;s
methodology—at least as an example of one fruitful way to pursue
philosophical questions—I will argue that Williamson’s idiosyncratic
understanding of logic and of semantics helps explain how he has come to such
surprising conclusions in epistemology (e.g. that we know all logical and
necessary truths) and metaphysics (e.g. that everything that exists exists
necessarily), and once we adopt a more well-rounded—and, dare I say,
orthodox—view of logic and semantics, the argument to these more surprising
conclusions are undercut, and a quite different picture emerges concerning the
place for logic, and formal tools more generally, in philosophy.

I will end
with some short, speculative suggestions about what this means for analytic
philosophy, more generally.
