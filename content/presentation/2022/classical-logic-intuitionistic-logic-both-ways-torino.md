*Abstract*: We know a great many technical results concerning the relationship between classical logic and intuitionistic logic, whether in the propositional, first-order or higher-order languages. We also know quite a lot about the relationship between intuitionistic and classical theories. In this talk, I will explore some of what these results might mean, from the perspective of *partisans* of one side or other of the divide, and what kinds of *pluralism* might be tenable, in the light of the existing and long-standing practices of classical and constructive mathematics.
