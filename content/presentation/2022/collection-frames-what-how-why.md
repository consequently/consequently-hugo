*Abstract*: In this talk, I give a breezy introduction to Collection Frames (joint work with [Shawn Standefer](https://shawn-standefer.github.io)), with an emphasis on how they are technically equivalent to, but conceptual simpler than Routley--Meyer ternary relational frames.

* The talk is an online presentation at the [New Directions in Relevant Logic](http://www.cs.cas.cz/ndr2022/) Online Workshop. 

* The [slides for the talk are available here](/slides/collection-frames-what-how-why.pdf).
