*Abstract*: In this talk, I introduce the difference between paraconsistency (adopting a logic for which a contradiction need not entail everything) and dialetheism (the notion that there are true contradictions), and I explain some reasons why one might take there to be true contradictions. I focus on Jc Beall’s recent work on contradictory Christology as one such motivation, and discuss some attractions of the view, as well as some shortcomings to be further explored.


* The talk is a face-to-face presentation at the University of St Andrews Philosophy Department’s “*Reflectorium*”, its regular work-in-progress day.
