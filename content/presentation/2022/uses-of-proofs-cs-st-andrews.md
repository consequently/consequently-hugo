*Abstract*: This talk is a free-wheeling introduction to my research, starting from work in substructural logics and logical pluralism, and ending at the many uses of proofs, including giving an account of how our modal vocabulary has the meaning that it does, and the connections between proof norms and the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue. 


* The talk is a face-to-face presentation at the University of St-Andrews Computer Science Departmentâ€™s *Research in School* day. 

* The [slides for the talk are available here](/slides/uses-of-proofs-cs-st-andrews.pdf).
