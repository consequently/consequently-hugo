*Abstract*:  In this talk, I will present an account of *defining rules*, with the aim of explaining these rules they play a central role in analytic proofs. Along the way, I'll explain how Kreisel's *squeezing argument* helps us understand the connection between an informal notion of validity and the notions formalised in our accounts of proofs and models, and the relationship between proof-theoretic and model- theoretic analyses of logical consequence.

* This is a talk for the [VII Workshop on Philosophical Logic](http://ba-logic.com/workshops/7th-workshop/).
