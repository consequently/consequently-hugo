*Abstract*: In this talk, I provide two different models for a theory of grounds meeting the following desiderata:\\(\def\\yright{\\succ}\\)

1. *Grammar*: There are objects, which we call *grounds*, which can be grounds *for* propositions or grounds *against* propositions.
2. *Derivation*: A derivation of a sequent \\(X\\yright A,Y\\) gives us a systematic way to construct a ground *for* \\(A\\) out of grounds for each member of \\(X\\) and grounds against each member of \\(Y\\), and a derivation of a sequent \\(X,A\\yright Y\\) gives us a systematic way to construct a ground *against* \\(A\\) out of grounds for each member of \\(X\\) and grounds against each member of \\(Y\\). So, a derivation of \\(\\yright A\\) gives us a way to construct a ground for \\(A\\), and a derivation of \\(A\\yright\\) gives us a way to construct a ground against \\(A\\).
3. *Interpretation*: This theory can be interpreted in an *epistemic* sense, where grounds are our means to access the truth or falsity of a proposition, or a *metaphysical* sense, where grounds show how a proposition is made true by the world.
4. *Grasp*: Grounds are the kinds of things we can *possess*.
5. *Hyperintensionality*: Not every ground is a ground for every tautology. A ground for \\(A\\) need not also be a ground for each logical consequence of \\(A\\).
6. *Structure*: A ground for \\(A\\to B\\) can be seen as a function from grounds for \\(A\\) to grounds for \\(B\\). A ground for \\(A\\land B\\) can be seen as consisting of a ground for \\(A\\) and a ground for \\(B\\). A ground against \\(A\\lor B\\) can be seen as consisting of a ground against \\(A\\) and a ground against \\(B\\). A ground for \\(\\neg A\\) can be obtained from a ground against \\(A\\), and a ground against \\(\\neg A\\) can be obtained from a ground for \\(A\\).

The result is a model of grounds with significant similarities to the BHK interpretation of constructive logic, but for the classical sequent calculus.
