*Abstract*: In this talk, I show how to incorporate insights from the model-theoretic semantics for negation (insights due to J. Michael Dunn, in his paper “[Star and Perp: Two Treatments of Negation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2214128)”), into a proof-first understanding of the semantics of negation. I then discuss how a logical pluralist may understand the underlying accounts of proofs and their significance. The result is a new perspective from which to view the connection between relevance and different notions of logical consequence.

* The talk is a face-to-face presentation at the [Logic, Reasoning, and Justification Workshop](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/logic/160569/logic-reasoning-and-justification) hosted by the Philosophy Department at the University of Bergen, in Norway.
