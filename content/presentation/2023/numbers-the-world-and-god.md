*Abstract*: In this talk, I illustrate some of the key ideas of the distinctively _Grammatical Thomist_ kind of apophaticism developed by Simon Hewitt, in his book _[Negative Theology and Philosophical Analysis: Only the Splendour of Light](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-49602-9)_. In particular, I explore the kind of semantic _anti-realism_ at the heart of the work, contrasting and complementing Hewitt's use of ideas from Wittgenstein, Dummett and McCabe with some themes from the recent work of the normative pragmatism of Robert Brandom. I use the prosaic examples of properly semantically _antirealist_ ways to understand the semantics of our talk of _numbers_ and of _the world_, to illustrate the general strategy. Then, using Brandomâ€™s distinction between _sense_ dependence and _reference_ dependence, I show how the proponent of such a non-referential semantics can respond to the criticism that any commitment to semantic anti-realism for some topic (whether _numbers_, _the world_ or _God_) is to conceive of the subject matter of that topic as dependent on or subservient to our own interests, concerns or concepts. 

I end this talk with some questions for Hewitt, concerning the behaviour of _kind_ talk and the concept of _identity_ invovled in his explanation of why God is totally unlike any other thing, and concerning what else may be distinctive about the _God_ concept.
