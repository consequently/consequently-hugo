**<span class="caps">PHIL30043</span>: The Power and Limits of Logic** (or, as I like to call it, <em>Kurt G&ouml;del's Greatest Hits</em>) is a [University of Melbourne undergraduate subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2020/PHIL30043). It covers the metatheory of classical first order predicate logic, beginning at the *Soundness* and *Completeness* Theorems, *Compactness*, *Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem*, the *Downward L&ouml;wenheim&ndash;Skolem Theorem*, *Recursive Functions*, *Register Machines*, *Representability*, the *Indefinability of Truth* and the *Undecidability of Predicate Logic*, and ending up at *G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems* and *L&ouml;b&rsquo;s Theorem*.

The subject is taught to University of Melbourne undergraduate students (for Arts students as a part of the Philosophy major, for non-Arts students, as a breadth subject). Details for enrolment are [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2020/PHIL30043). 

The subject is taught to University of Melbourne undergraduate students (for Arts students as a part of the Philosophy major, for non-Arts students, as a breadth subject). Details for enrolment are [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2020/PHIL30043). I make use of video lectures I have made [freely available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvROQ_RldgC8KYmkQsF_zKqAXD_Xphr9n).

### Outline

The course is divided into four major sections, taught over 12 weeks. Here is a list of all of the videos, in case you'd like to follow along with the content.
