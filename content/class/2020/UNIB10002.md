**<span class="caps">UNIB10002</span>: Logic, Language and Information** is a [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) undergraduate breadth subject, introducing logic and its applications to students from a wide range of disciplines in the Arts, Sciences and Engineering. I coordinate this subject with my colleague Dr. Jen Davoren, with help from Prof. Lesley Stirling (Linguistics), Dr. Peter Schachte (Computer Science) and Dr. Daniel Murfet (Mathematics).

The subject is taught to University of Melbourne undergraduate students. Details for enrolment are [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2020/UNIB10002).
