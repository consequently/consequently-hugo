This is an intensive class on logical and philosophical issues in proof theory,
taught at <a hrfef="https://scool24.github.io/NLS/"><span class="caps">nls2024</span></a> 
as part of the [Reykjavik Summer of Cool Logic 2024](https://scool24.github.io).

In this course, I’ll introduce natural deduction and sequent calculus for
classical, constructive and substructural logics, motivating and explaining how
key results (normalisation for natural deduction proofs and cut elimination for
sequent calculus derivations) may be proved, and how these interact with the
presence or absence of the structural rules of weakening and contraction. We
will also take a look at different proof systems designed to model modal and
other intensional logics. Along the way we will see (1) the difference between
multiplicative and additive rules for connectives (2) different ways to
understand _harmony_ between introduction and elimination rules (or left and
right rules in the sequent calculus) (3) the ways in which rules for a
connective may be understood as _defining_ the concept introduced; (4) the
connection between proof dynamics, dialogue and speech acts; (5) the
relationship between proof search and model construction, and (6) connections
between structural rules, paradoxes and fixed points.
