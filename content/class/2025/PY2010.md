**<span class="caps">py2010</span>: Intermediate Logic** is a University of St Andrews undergraduate subject in which we cover important results in logic to philosophy students. It’s taught by [Greg Restall](https://consequently.org), together with a committed crew of postgraduate students.

The subject introduces the proof theory and model theory of propositional, modal and predicate logic–in that order. I’m using the new textbook [Logical Methods](https://consequently.org/writing/logical_methods/), written with my colleague [Shawn Standefer](https://shawn-standefer.github.io).
