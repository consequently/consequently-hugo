**<span class="caps">py1012</span>: Reasoning** introduces the essential concepts and techniques of critical reasoning, formal propositional logic, and basic predicate logic. Among the central questions are these: what distinguishes an argument from a mere rhetorical ploy? What makes an argument a good one? How can we formally prove that a conclusion follows from some premises? In addressing these questions, we will also cover topics such as ambiguity, argument forms and analyses, induction compared to deduction, counterexamples, truth-tables, natural deduction, and quantification.
