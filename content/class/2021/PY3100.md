**<span class="caps">py3100</span>: Reading Philosophy 1&ndash;Texts in Language, Logic, Mind, Epistemology, Metaphysics and Science** is designed to develop the philosophical skills students have acquired over the first two years of their philosophy study, and acquaint them with key works in core areas of philosophy. The module involves close study of philosophical texts &ndash; historical and contemporary &ndash; that address a variety of topics within metaphysics, epistemology, the philosophies of logic and language, mind and science. Students will be required to carry out close study and discussion of these texts in staff-led weekly workshops, thereby furthering their skills of critical evaluation and analysis. Students will also take turns in presenting papers to the workshop, in pair-groups, which will help them to develop important communication skills and provide an opportunity for teamwork.
