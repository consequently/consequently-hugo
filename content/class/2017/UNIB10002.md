**<span class="caps">UNIB10002</span>: Logic, Language and Information** is a [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) undergraduate breadth subject, introducing logic and its applications to students from a broad range of disciplines in the Arts, Sciences and Engineering. I coordinate this subject with my colleagues Dr. Shawn Standefer, with help from Prof. Lesley Stirling (Linguistics), Dr. Peter Schachte (Computer Science) and Dr. Daniel Murfet (Mathematics).

The subject is taught to University of Melbourne undergraduate students. Details for enrolment are [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2017/UNIB10002). We teach this in a &lsquo;flipped classroom&rsquo; model, using resources from our Coursera subjects [Logic 1](/class/2015/logic1_coursera) and [Logic 2](/class/2015/logic2_coursera).
