<p>We went to the <a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/visiting.cfm?zoo_id=1">Zoo</a> on Sunday afternoon.  It was <em>very</em> busy, dodging all of the other prams and strollers.  The zoo is only a couple of minutes (drive) away from our place: it&rsquo;s halfway between our house and the university.  So, we&rsquo;ve become &ldquo;<a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/FOTZ/">Friends of the Zoo</a>&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s great to visit during the week, when it&rsquo;s much quieter.</p>
