<p>Success!  We'll soon be signing a lease to live in this house:</p>
<img src="http://consequently.org/images/NewPlace.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Our New Place" />
<p>It's a sweet three bedroom cottage, with a little backyard and front garden.  Room enough for visitors, so come and visit sometime.  We move in when we arrive in Melbourne: in around two week's time.</p>  
<p>(I never thought I'd live in a house with a picket fence, but there you go.)</p>
