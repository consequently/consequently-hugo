I'm in sunny and wintry Banff at the [Mathematical Methods in Philosophy](http://www.pims.math.ca/birs/birspages.php?task=displayevent&event_id=07w5060) workshop.  The program is [very full](http://www.pims.math.ca/birs/workshops/2007/07w5060/Programme07w5060.pdf), and I won't be able to report on *everything* going on here.  (Heck, I haven't even reported back from our time in India, despite [popular demand](http://consequently.org/news/2006/12/19/off_to_india/).)  So, please let me give my apologies in advance if youre talk doesn't get reported here.  It's probably because I was so interested in it I had to *think* and not blog.
