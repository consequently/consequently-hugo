I'm waiting in Gate 9 at the international terminal [Melbourne Airport](http://www.melbourne-airport.com.au/), getting ready to board my first flight on my trip to Europe.  It's not a short hop -- Singapore/Frankfurt/Prague, but at least I'll be in a [very nice place](http://www.mcdo.cz/) for what to all appearances will be a [very enjoyable conference](http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&id_categoryNode=852).  From then, it's [Bonn](http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/), and then Denmark (K&oslash;benhavn, and &Aring;rhus) to meet up with Christine and Zachary, to have a little [holiday](http://www.legoland.dk) while Christine does some work.  On the way out, it's Wroc&#322;aw, where I'll play a little part in a [big conference](http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html) before heading home with Zachary.

Please, let me know if you're going to be around anywhere in the vicinity during this European trip.  I'll be catching up with some mates, but it's always fun to meet more friends.

(If I owe you an email, that's because I've been ridiculously busy preparing for this trip, teaching courses, looking after the boy, etc... But I'm ploughing through my backlog, and I might *just* get there in the next few weeks.  One can hope!)
