I’ve returned from a [productive](/w/prm)
[semester](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/must-do-mdb-better-sep/)
[of](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/type-theory-and-phil-logic-types/)
[research](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/mlce-illc/)
[leave](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/mathematical-practice-proof-assistants-and-meaning-calgary/),
and I’m enjoying being back in the classroom [teaching *Intermediate
Logic*](https://consequently.org/class/2025/py2010/).

Now that my [big book](/w/prm) has a complete first draft, my writing energies
are focused elsewhere.  I'm gearing up to give the [2025 Wendy Huang
Lectures](/p/whl) in Taiwan next month, so from this coming Wednesday, I’ll be
giving the material [a test
run](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/whl-a/) with the home crowd.
