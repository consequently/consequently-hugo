This month’s reading was mostly nonfiction, featuring [Kevin
Hart](https://divinity.duke.edu/faculty/kevin-hart)’s _[Contemplation (The
Movements of the
Soul)](https://bookshop.org/p/books/contemplation-the-movements-of-the-soul-kevin-hart/21254132?ean=9780231213479&next=t&next=t)_,
[Haruki Murakami](https://harukimurakami.com)’s essay collection _[Novelist as
a
Vocation](https://bookshop.org/p/books/novelist-as-a-vocation-haruki-murakami/18304495?ean=9781101974537)_,
the harrowing  _[Chasing Shadows: The Life and Death of Peter
Roebuck](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/chasing-shadows-the-life-and-death-of-peter-roebuck-elliot-cartledge/2154366?ean=9781743790120)_
by [Tim Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Lane_(journalist)) and [Elliot
Cartledge](https://publishing.hardiegrant.com/en-gb/authors/elliot-cartledge),
[Drew Neil](http://drewneil.com)’s  _[Practical
Vim](https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition/)_ (I’m
trying to brush up my text editing skills), and finally,  [Timothy
Larsen](https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/faculty/timothy-larsen/)’s _[George
MacDonald in the Age of
Miracles](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/george-macdonald-in-the-age-of-miracles-incarnation-doubt-and-reenchantment-timothy-larsen/2207644?ean=9780830853731)_.

I rounded off the month enjoying my next two instalments of [Dan
Moren](https://dmoren.com/)’s Galactic Cold War series, the short story
_[Showdown](https://dmoren.com/writing/short-stories/)_ and the rollicking
novel _[The Aleph
Extraction](https://dmoren.com/writing/galactic-cold-war/the-aleph-extraction/)_. That was a fun read on the 
flight to Australia.
