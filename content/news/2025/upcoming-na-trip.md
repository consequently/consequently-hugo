In a few days, I’m heading off to North America, for a brief trip to give a few
talks, at [Chapman
University](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/mlce-ocie/) in
California,
[Calgary](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/mathematical-practice-proof-assistants-and-meaning-calgary/)
[University](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/mlce-calgary/) in
Alberta, and finally, a brief stop at
[CUNY](https://consequently.org/presentation/2025/mlce-cuny-lm/) in New York. 
I’m looking forward to meeting new friends and catching up with old ones, as well
as the chance to talk with smart people about my research.

Meanwhile, I’ve managed to do a bit of reading during February, as I’ve been
preparing for this trip.

First up, I read *[Dylan Goes Electric!: Newport, Seeger, Dylan, and the night
that split the
Sixties](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/dylan-goes-electric-newport-seeger-dylan-and-the-night-that-split-the-sixties-elijah-wald/1450281?ean=9780062366696)*, by 
[Elijah Wald](https://elijahwald.com), after watching [A Complete
Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Complete_Unknown). It’s a long and
winding tale, which introduced me to the world of folk music in the US in the
1960s, which was unfamiliar with me.  

The other non-fiction for the month was *[Truth and Repair: How
trauma survivors envision
justice](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/truth-and-repair-how-trauma-survivors-envision-justice-judith-herman/7256167?ean=9781529395006)*, by
[Judith Lewis Herman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Lewis_Herman); 
[Henri Nouwen](https://henrinouwen.org)’s
*[Spiritual
Direction](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/spiritual-direction-wisdom-for-the-long-walk-of-faith-henri-nouwen/2829514?ean=9780281064229)*,
and *[The Sirens’ Call: How attention became the world's most endangered
resource](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-sirens-call-how-attention-became-the-world-s-most-endangered-resource-chris-hayes/7759088?aid=1019&ean=9781914484940)*, by [Chris Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes).

There was only one novel this month: 
[Kaliane Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliane_Bradley)’s 
*[The Ministry of Time](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-ministry-of-time-kaliane-bradley/7445878?ean=9781399726344)*. This was a fun and mind-bending read. I think the initial 80% was much stronger than the final 20%, but the whole thing was worth the read. I think I’ll try to read more fiction while on my trip. Let’s all see how this plan pans out!
