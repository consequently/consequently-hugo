Alongside coordinating and lecturing in [PY2010: Intermediate
Logic](/class/2025/py2010) this semester, I have the fun task of teaching one
of the tutorial groups, together with our enthusiastic and capable graduate student 
tutors. My Tuesday morning cohort is a microcosm of the diverse 
international student body at [St Andrews](http://st-andrews.ac.uk). 

Of the 13 students, we have two each from England, China, and the USA, and we
have one each from Botswana, Denmark, France, Greece, Hong Kong, Scotland and
Spain. That's a diverse bunch.

In addition, six of the 13 are Philosophy majors, six are Mathematics majors, 
five major in International Relations, and we have one each from French, Computer
Science and Psychology. (I haven't miscounted: some of our students are completing
double majors.)

Finally, this cohort consists of eight women and five men. Given their submissions
for our first tutorial, starting tomorrow—and given the engagement and enthusiasm that
the whole group are showing in lectures—I'm looking forward to spending time with them.
