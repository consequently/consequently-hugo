I've finally added enclosures to my [RSS feed of papers](http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml).  This means that if you subscribe to my papers page using that feed, and you're using an RSS reader that handles enclosures (this feature is primarily used for podcasts), then you can get it to download my papers automatically.

This has the side effect that you can subscribe to me in [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes): 

![Papers in iTunes](https://consequently.org/pictures/papers_in_itunes.png)

That is *weird*.  (I wonder if I should submit this podcast to the iTunes Music Store?)
