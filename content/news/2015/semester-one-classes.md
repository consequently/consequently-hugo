Teaching started for first semester, with the launch of [Logic: Language and Information 1](/class/2015/logic1_coursera/) on Coursera. That's been a lot of fun already, with over 17,000 enrolled. There's something very exciting about being involved with a large number of students all around the world, choosing to work hard to learn logic for the first time.

I'm most excited, though, by the next run-through of [Kurt G&ouml;del's Greatest Hits](/class/2015/PHIL30043), starting next week. This time, I'm teaching the class entirely in a flipped mode, with students working through the [lecture videos](/2015/PHIL30043) *before class* each week, and working with me on a mix of simpler peer instruction questions to establish the basic understanding of core concepts,  and going on to more complex material and independent engagement with the material. We meet weekly in a two hour seminar (from 9 to 11am each Monday&mdash;what a way to start the week!). With a group of between 25 and 30 students, this will be intense! 

There's a lot of ground to cover, from soundness and completeness Theorems, through compactness, cardinality L&oslash;wenheim&ndash;Skolem theorems, computability, to G&ouml;del's Theorems and L&ouml;b's Theorem. It'll be quite a ride. This material *isn't* available through Coursera, but I have made the videos [available for your use](/class/2015/PHIL30043) if you wish. (I only ask that you acknowledge that you got them from here if you make them publicly available in any medium.)
