While [recovering the archives for this site](/news/2015/recovering-the-past/), I came across another blast from the past: the [weblog I ran](http://pluralism.pitas.com) with [Jc](http://entailments.net) during the early days of our research on logical pluralism. 

<!--more-->

[It's a weblog](http://pluralism.pitas.com) that we ran from to October 1999 to September 2001, with things we found related to logical pluralism, notes from our research, and details of talks and various other bits and pieces along the way. If you're interested in the nuances of logical pluralism, there's lots of material there, some of which didn't make it into [our book](http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism/).

It's worth noting that in an age where many other free online services shut up shop and disappeared, the platform &ldquo;pitas&rdquo; is still faithfully serving up those pages. It launched in 1999, along with [Diaryland](http://diaryland.com), which is still going strong after all of these years. (Read [the story of Andrew Smales, the founder, here](https://medium.com/@maryps/a-conversation-with-andrew-smales-founder-of-diaryland-15e3d1ffc7dc) for the backstory.)

It might also worth be snoting that back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, I was also into the simple black and white with red highlights colour scheme.
