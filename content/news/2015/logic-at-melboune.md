I've been at the [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au/) since 2002, and the *Logic Group* has been meeting regularly since my arrival there. While it's changed significantly in its [membership over the last 13 years](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/people/), one thing has remained constant—we've been an informal, friendly bunch of people, so hard at work in teaching and research that we've not had time to make a website for the group. Well, thanks to the hardworking [Shawn Standefer](http://standefer.net), that's changed. Point your browsers to [http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/) to keep up with *Logic at Melbourne*.
