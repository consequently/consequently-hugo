Tomorrow I head off on a *flying visit* to Oxford for a [Workshop on Verbal Disputes and their Philosophical Significance](https://verbaldisputesoxford.wordpress.com). I'm looking forward to catching up with old friends and making new ones. The lineup for the workshop is fantastic, so it looks like it'll be a great time. If you're in the area, please do come along and say "hi". If you can't come, I've posted the slides and handout for my talk [here](http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/verbal-disputes-oxford/).

<!--more--> I'm away from Melbourne from late May 18, and I return on May 24. Six nights away, two nights in planes and four in the UK. It's a ridiculously short trip, given that I'm flying halfway across the world. But I teach classes on Mondays and I don't want to cancel any of those so near to the end of the semester, so this time it will be a very quick trip.
