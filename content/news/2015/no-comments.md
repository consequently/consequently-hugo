Previous incarnations of this website provided a facility for comments in the usual way for a weblog in the first decade of the 2000s&mdash;a comment form on each entry. This one doesn't. Why not?

<!--more-->

It's simple. Comment forms are ugly. I don't want to spend time *moderating comments*&mdash;wading through yet another medium that's 90% spam is  not a good way for me to use my time or energy. Publically available comment forms on the web are mostly buckets for spam and other detritus. 

Most importantly, there are *plenty of other ways* you can comment on anything I do here. 

* The best way is to [reply to me on twitter](http://twitter.com/consequently). Use your favourite twitter client and post a link to news item you're discussing. 
	
	If you include the reference to my twitter handle [@consequently](http://twitter.com/consequently),  or if you simply link to a page on this site, I'll see your reply when I check twitter. It's really easy for me to include tweets in posts, like this one &hellip; <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>All-star logic workshop in Banff, 2007 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TT?src=hash">#TT</a> <a href="http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl">http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl</a> <a href="http://t.co/yMX8yHufgn">pic.twitter.com/yMX8yHufgn</a></p>&mdash; Richard Zach (@RrrichardZach) <a href="https://twitter.com/RrrichardZach/status/558299627569836032">January 22, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> &hellip; so if you'd like to comment, that's a great way to get a short message out, in public. 

* Or, if you've got something that's longer than a tweet's worth, write it, make it available on the web, and let me know. If I get useful feedback in public, I'll try to link to it on the page, or point readers to it on twitter. 

* Or you could always just [send me an email](#about).
