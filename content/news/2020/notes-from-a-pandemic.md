I’ve been up to a few things during the pandemic. Quite a few things, it seems. Here are links to some of the traces you can find elsewhere on the internet.

I wouldn't say that I've become *good* at using Zoom, but I have been doing a heck of a lot of it. [My](http://consequently.org/class/2020/unib10002/) [three](http://consequently.org/class/2020/phil30043/) [subjects](http://consequently.org/class/2020/phil40013/) for this semester moved online, and running seminars, workshops, classes over Zoom has become a part (only a part) of keeping the ship going. I don't record those classes (for obvious reasons!) but I have recorded a couple of research seminars presentations I've made over the last few weeks. 

First up, as the shift to off-campus online teaching was just starting, in late March, I decided to try giving a research seminar presentation over Zoom, for the [Melbourne Logic Group Seminar](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/logic-seminar/). That was fun, because I got to see an audience from all over the world. You can [see the recording here](https://consequently.org/presentation/2020/geometric-models-logicmelb/).

Then, months later, in early May, I got to do another research presentation, after having had over 50 Zoom classes/seminars/meetings as practice in the mean time. Maybe you can see some difference in [the second talk, which you can see here](https://consequently.org/presentation/2020/assertion-denial-common-ground-acu/). That was a talk “at” the new [Dianoia Institute of Philosophy](https://www.acu.edu.au/research/our-research-institutes/dianoia-institute-of-philosophy) at the Australian Catholic University.

One of the upsides of the pandemic's forced move to online work has been the internationalisation of our research seminars. My colleague [Shawn Standefer](https://shawn-standefer.github.io) was instrumental in establishing the [Logic Supergroup](http://ba-logic.com/logic-supergroup/), an international collaboration between research groups in logic all over the globe, and we've been sharing seminars and enjoying catching up with each other during this time of isolation. I wonder what the “new normal” will be, after the pandemic. I hope we keep some of this different way of working after we are able to resume face-to-face meetings.

Shawn and I have also somehow been able to keep writing during this time. I'm most proud of this [joint paper](https://consequently.org/writing/collection-frames/), which brings together ideas we've had over the last 18 months or so. I think it's a genuine advance in our understanding of the frame semantics for relevant logics, and it's the paper I'm most proud of having written, in recent years. 

Finally, last week I recorded a wide-ranging conversation with Aleks Hammo, for his podcast, Aleks Listens. We talked about logic, philosophy, belief, and the state of the world. If you like that sort of thing, you might like to [listen along, here](https://alekslistens.podbean.com/e/43-prof-greg-restall-logic-society-belief-and-the-self/).
