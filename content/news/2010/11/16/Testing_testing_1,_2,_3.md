Just testing to see if this thing is on.  Yes, it seems to be working.  How about that!? It's pretty rusty, but apparently this site still works. That's good to see.

Here's a few items of news.

* I've been way too busy coordinating the [Philosophy program](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne to be posting here. It's been a busy ride for the year, but it's been fantastic. It looks like I'll be in the saddle again for 2011, so hopefully having learned how to hold the reins this year, I'll be able to post here a little more next year.  No promises though.

* I've been writing. Doing lots of writing.  You'll see a few changes on the [writing](http://consequently.org/writing) page. I'm most happy with the new paper "[A Cut-Free Sequent System for Two-Dimensional Modal Logic: and why it matters](http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/)." There's a little philosophy there, and a little proof theory, too. It's not too long (just 24 pages), and I'd appreciate your comments. Head over to the [paper page](http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/) to download the paper and post your comments.  (Make sure you admire the in-line diagrams on page 16. That's LaTeX, with no postprocessing.)

* My next travels involve a trip to Guangzhou to take part in [SELLC 2010](http://www.math.helsinki.fi/logic/sellc-2010/). That's going to be a blast, helping teach a Winter School to a bunch of enthusiastic students, and with a great slate of lecturers. It'll be good to catch up with Samson, Robin, Mehrnoosh and Dag, and to meet the rest of the lecturers, as well as my colleagues at the [ILC](http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/english/Index.asp) at Sun Yat-Sen University.  On the way home from Guangzhou, I'll take a quick side trip to Boston for the Eastern APA, to contribute to a session on the future of logic, with [John Horty](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~horty/) and [Johan van Benthem](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan/).  What fun!  This will be my first ever APA, so if you have any advice for an APA neophyte, do let me know.
