I've completed the moderation of the exam for _[Intermediate
Logic](https://consequently.org/class/2024/py2010/)_, and with that, the final
administrative responsibilities for this semester are complete. Now it's time
to take a short break over Christmas and the New Year, and then to start 
a semester of research leave. I'm looking forward to time set aside to think,
to write, and to talk to colleagues, near and far.

I have some trips lined up, to North America, and to continental Europe, in the 
months ahead. I'll post notice of these
[here](https://consequently.org/presentation/), as the details are ironed down.
In the mean time, I'm looking forward to having that time to think and to
write.
