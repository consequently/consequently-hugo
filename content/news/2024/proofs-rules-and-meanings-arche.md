I’ve just emerged from two intense days of proof theory. Three of my graduate
students, [Sophie Nagler](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/sophie-emilie-nagler), 
[Viviane Fairbank](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/viviane-fairbank) and 
[Francisca Silva](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/francisca-silva), organised a
[two-day workshop](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/event/workshop-proofs-rules-and-meanings/) on 
proof theory and its connections to philosophy and other fields.

It was a delightful event, filled with good talks, great conversations, and
I've emerged, buzzing with lots of new ideas.  It was extra special to experience
interactions between people who have been part of the field since its inception
&mdash; [Peter
Schroeder-Heister](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/logik-und-sprachtheorie/persons/prof-dr-peter-schroeder-heister/)
invented the phrase _proof-theoretic semantics_, and our own [Stephen
Read](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html) has been publishing on proof
theory since the 1980s &mdash; with some _slightly_ more junior folks, like
[Catarina Dutilh-Novaes](https://www.cdutilhnovaes.com), [Elaine
Pimentel](https://sites.google.com/site/elainepimentel/), [Luca
Incurvati](https://sites.google.com/site/lucaincurvati/home), [Sara
Uckelman](https://sites.google.com/site/lucaincurvati/home) and me, who are
well and truly established in the field &mdash; with the newer generation of younger
researchers, like my former PhD student [Bogdan Dicher](http://bdicher.me) (now
a lecturer in philosophy at
[Witwaterstrand](https://www.wits.ac.za/people/academic-a-z-listing/d/bogdandicherwitsacza/),
[Sara Ayhan](https://sites.google.com/view/sara-ayhan/home) (now a postdoc at
[Bochum](https://www.pe.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophie/i/logic/team/ayhan.html.de)),
and the current crop of graduate students, including [Sophie](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/sophie-emilie-nagler) and [Viviane](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/viviane-fairbank),
together with [Robin Martinot](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RAMartinot/) (a student
at Utrecht). Some undergraduate students from St Andrews dropped by and came to a few 
talks, and we had visitors from all around the world, both in person and online. 
Thanks to Sophie, Viviane and Francisca for pulling off such a worthwhile workshop.

Now that I've had a night to reflect and a day to recover, I can take stock and think
about where we've got to. The workshop and the conversations we had over the last couple of
days has underlined for me the wide range of work that's done in proof-theoretic semantics. 
This ranges 
from the _obvious_ connections with type theory, proof assistants and automated reasoning
at the technical engineering end of the field, to 
philosophical questions about how the technical results of proof theory relate to the
semantic concerns of traditional theories of meaning, and issues of reference, truth conditions
and possible worlds model theory. But there was another strand to our conversations: 
Sara Uckleman and Stephen Read encouraged us to develop a nuanced account of the history of the use 
of proof-like concepts as people have attempted to understand our capacity to think and talk
about the world. There was a level of curiosity and cross-fertilisation between approaches and
different traditions that is deeply encouraging and enjoyable to be a part of.

This work has a _depth_ and _coherence_ that means that individual researchers
can pursue their own questions without devoting too much time to defending their turf and 
fending off attacks from others who can't see the point of addressing questions _that_ way.
(Students have been advised, even in the recent past, to not consider proof theory as an 
area of logic worth studying, on the grounds that it was a dead end and all the interesting
questions were answered by the 1970s. No reasonable person could believe this now.) 

If this workshop is any sign, the future of the field is bright. So many young people &mdash; 
and especially, so many young women &mdash; are putting their stamp on this research area, and it will
be exciting to see how the research agenda will shift and grow in the years ahead.
