I mentioned [yesterday](https://consequently.org/news/2024/books-sep-oct-nov/) that this month I've 
enjoyed rereading Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars Trilogy*. This time around, after completing my 
re-read, I've enjoyed listening to 
[Marooned on Mars](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/marooned-on-mars/), a podcast devoted
to Kim Stanley Robinson's fiction. The initial conceit of the podcast was that the hosts,
[Matt Hauske](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/directory/profiles/hauske-matt.html) and 
[Hilary Strang](https://maph.uchicago.edu/hilary-strang) (two humanities academics, based in Chicago)
would take a section from the *Mars Trilogy*, one episode at a time, and discuss it, drawing out
themes, pointing out connections, and generally, enjoying talking about the work.

Hilary and Matt know
their stuff (Hilary [teaches literature, and in particular, science fiction](https://maph.uchicago.edu/hilary-strang),
while Matt [works in cinema studies](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/directory/profiles/hauske-matt.html)),
but the conversation reads as a discussion between knowledgeable friends, rather than an academic seminar.

A highlight of the initial series of podcasts, on the Mars Trilogy, is their delight (and trepidation)
over being contacted by Kim Stanley Robinson himself, who has turned out to be
a listener (and fellow fan) of the podcast. He's now appeared on the podcast a
couple of times, and it's insightful to see an author
respond&ndash;nondefensively&ndash;to critical and sympathetic readers of their
work. There's lots to enjoy here, and Matt and Hilary have continued their podcast to cover other KSR novels, too. 
I will return to [Marooned on
Mars](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/marooned-on-mars/) when KSR returns to my reading pile. Thanks, Hilary and Matt.
