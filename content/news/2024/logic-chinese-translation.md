Earlier this month I got a lovely package in the mail. A Chinese translation of my [intro logic text](https://consequently.org/writing/logic/). My colleague and friend Min Xu completed his translation of my text, and it’s [now available](https://consequently.org/writing/logic_chinese_translation/).
