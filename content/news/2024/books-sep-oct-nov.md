This teaching semester has been [keeping](http://consequently.org/class/2024/py2010/) [me](https://consequently.org/presentation/2024/what-can-we-mean-aristo/) [so](https://consequently.org/presentation/2024/defining-quantifiers-mcmp/) [busy](http://consequently.org/class/2024/py2010/) that I have not kept up with my monthly reading logs. I've had enough time to _read_, but I haven't found the time to keep you, *my* reader, up with what I’ve been reading. I'll attempt to remedy this now, by giving a very brisk run-down of my reading over the last three months. 

This last three months has been dominated by _fiction_ reading, so let me start
with the little pile of non-fiction that I enjoyed. First, for the philosophy,
I enjoyed [Todd May](https://www.toddmayphilosopher.com)'s *[Friendship in an
age of
Economics](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/friendship-in-an-age-of-economics-resisting-the-forces-of-neoliberalism-todd-may/3156710)*,
a nice little work in moral/social psychology on the value of friendship and
its usefulness as giving us insight into value that does not register in our
econometric age. For theology, I enjoyed one longer book,  [*Women and the
Gender of
God*](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/women-and-the-gender-of-god-amy-peeler/7154340?ean=9780802879097),
by [Amy Peeler](https://amypeeler.com), and two very slim books, [*Why Did
Jesus Have to
Die?*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jesus-Have-Little-Book-Guidance/dp/0281074402),
by [Jane Williams](https://stmellitus.ac.uk/staff/jane-williams) and
*[Passions of the
Soul](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/passions-of-the-soul-9781399415682/)*, by
Jane's husband, [Rowan Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Williams).
The little Buddhist text on mindul living, [*The Practice of Not
Thinking*](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-practice-of-not-thinking-a-guide-to-mindful-living-ryunosuke-koike/2942032?ean=9780141994611),
by Ryunosuke Koike was a fun read, too. The final non-fiction book from the
last three months was very different to all of the others: [Daniel P.
Friedman](https://legacy.cs.indiana.edu/~dfried/) and [David Thrane
Christiansen](https://davidchristiansen.dk)'s fun little dialogue *[The Little
Typer](https://thelittletyper.com)* was a sweet little introduction to
dependent type theory, which I've been [thinking
about](https://consequently.org/writing/what-can-we-mean/) lately, and I plan to
think about this some more in the coming year.

Here's the _fiction_ from the last three months: I started off September reading [Mary Doria Russell](https://marydoriarussell.net)'s [*The Sparrow*](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-sparrow-mary-doria-russell/570295?ean=9780552997775), a tale of a failed(?) Jesuit interplanetary mission to another (interstellar) planet. It’s a haunting, unsettling story, about faith, expectations, taking a leap into the dark, and what happens when everything goes wrong.  Another novel about expectations was [Vinson Cunningham](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/vinson-cunningham)'s  *[Great Expectations](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/great-expectations-a-national-us-bestseller-vinson-cunningham/7768277)*, a semi-autobiographical novel about a young African-American worker on a presidential campaign for a young charismatic African-American Senator from Illinois (never named). I read this early in October, and the resonances and the dissimilarities with the 2024 US presidential campaign were striking. 

I also enjoyed two (short) novels from prize-winning authors: _[The Vegetarian](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-vegetarian-a-novel-han-kang/4205094)_, by [Han Kang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Kang) and  _[Morning and Evening](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/morning-and-evening-jon-fosse/2682395)_, by [Jon Fosse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Fosse), were both striking, beautifully written, tales from places (Korea, and Norway) the extremities of life, that I have not seen so starkly portrayed.  Both stories will stay with me for a long time.

For a fun escapade, I read *[The Caledonian Gambit](https://dmoren.com/writing/galactic-cold-war/the-caledonian-gambit/)*, the first entryt in [Dan Moren](https://dmoren.com)'s sci-fi/espionage thriller. I enjoyed the ride so much I immediately devoured  *[Pilot Error](https://dmoren.com/writing/short-stories/)*, the follow-up short story, and look forward to continuing the story with *[The Bayern Agenda](https://dmoren.com/writing/galactic-cold-war/the-bayern-agenda/)*, soon. 

However, with the tension of the upcoming US election building (and then the disappointing but unsurprising let-down of the result), I decided to return to re-read [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info)’s _Mars Trilogy_, which I first read in on their release, in the 1990s. The three novels,  *[Red Mars](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/red-mars-kim-stanley-robinson/2627731)*,  *[Green Mars](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/green-mars-kim-stanley-robinson/2627736)* and  *[Blue Mars](https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/blue-mars-kim-stanley-robinson?variant=39410786533454)* tell the centuries-long tale of the human settlement of Mars, starting with the original mission of the first hundred, a US/Russian/International team of 100 scientists, and the scientific, engineering, social and political struggles involved in establishing human settlement in a new world. This time I added to my reading *[The Martians](https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/the-martians-kim-stanley-robinson?variant=32545749991502)*, the collection of associated short stories set in the same context (or interestingly _alternate_ contexts, to consider some counterfactual scenarios where other choices are made.)  

[KSR](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info) always tells a thoughtful tale, in which we take a human perspective on world-historical events, and it was refreshing to spend time with smart folks trying to work their way into a liveable future for themselves and their neigbours (on Earth, and by the end of _Green Mars_, across the solar system), in the face of division, crisis and an unstable environment. Perhaps there's something in that for all of us. There was something in that for me, at least, as we head into the uncertain future of the coming years.
