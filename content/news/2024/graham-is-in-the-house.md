This week, Aaron Cotnoirâ€™s [Instruments of
Unity](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/projects/iou/) project and I are
hosting a short visit from our friend (and my PhD supervisor), [Professor
Graham Priest](http://grahampriest.net). It's always enjoyable to spend time
with him, and tomorrow, we're going to teach a the second-last lecture class
for my [Intermediate Logic](/class/2024/PY2010) cohort together, on the liar
paradox and non-classical logic. 

Today, he gave a talk on *nothing* and its paradoxical properties.
