<p>Jazz at the Zoo.  January 11, 2002.</p>
<p>The place was <em>packed</em> with easily more than 4000 people crowded in to the Zoo grounds to hear Don Burrows and Nina Ferro in the <a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/newspage.cfm?p=314&CFID=620970&CFTOKEN=6628730">Zoo Twilights</a> music program.  They were in good form, and a fine night was had by all.</p>
