<p>It&rsquo;s time for a new picture.  This picture was taken last December on the infamous <a href="http://consequently.org/news/archives/000107.html">Williamstown Ferry trip</a>.</p>
<p>Classes start next week, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to them, even though preparation has been a bit tight.  I am especially interested to see how my <a href="http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161438/pub/">fourth year honours class</a> enjoy what I have in store for them.  Hopefully by the time I am done, the students will know a whole lot more, and I will have written the literature review for my next book.</p>
