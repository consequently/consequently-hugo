<p>Butterfly, at the Zoo, December 2002.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the 2003 redesign for the site.  It&rsquo;s late, if you count calendar years, but it&rsquo;s early, if you count our teaching year.  Classes don&rsquo;t start for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The design includes the &lsquo;Snippets&rsquo; section, which will include links I find in day-to-day browsing.  This <em>news</em> section will contain photos and longer items of interest.</p>
