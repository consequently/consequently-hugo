<p>Zachary had a difficult day today, missing his afternoon sleep, and getting a bit cranky as a result.  This evening, as I was cooking dinner for Christine and myself, and supervising Zachary eating his dinner, he decided he&rsquo;d had enough of his meal (i.e., he had fingered it a bit, no more), which he had specifically requested (chicken + vegetable rissole and toast, please), and would much prefer grapes.  The scene continued something like this:</p>
<p><em>Zachary</em>: &ldquo;Grapes.  Grapes.  More grapes.&rdquo;  Approaches the refrigerator and opens the door.</p>
<p><em>Daddy</em>: &ldquo;No grapes, Zachary, until you&rsquo;ve had some more of your dinner.  You asked for the chicken, and I think you should eat some more.&rdquo;  Gently shuts the fridge door.</p>
<p><em>Zachary</em>: &ldquo;No chicken.  Grapes.&rdquo;  Opens fridge door.</p>
<p><em>Daddy</em>: &ldquo;No grapes yet, Zachary.  Not until you have had some more chicken.  You asked for the chicken, and I made it for you.&rdquo; (Speaking not quite truthfully, as I had simply reheated the rissole, and toasted and buttered the toast.  Zachary and Christine had done the lions share of making the rissoles a couple of days before.)  Shuts fridge door again.</p>
<p><em>Zachary</em>: Falls face down on floor (classic tantrum position), and says in a clear, calm voice, &ldquo;Tantrum.  Tantrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Daddy</em>: Quizzically. &ldquo;Are you having a tantrum?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Zachary</em>: Calmly.  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Gets up by himself and returns to his dinner to eat some more.</p>
<p>If he understands his own emotional state this well by the time he is in his teenage years, I should be a very happy father.</p>
