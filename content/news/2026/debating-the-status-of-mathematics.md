The [St Andrews Union Debating Society](https://www.stadebates.com/) is a long-standing institution around these parts. Founded in 1794, this student-run society hosts regular debates. Last week, the society collaborated with [SUMS](https://sums-sta.github.io/), the St Andrews University Mathematics Society, to host a [public debate on the status of mathematics](https://www.stadebates.com/event/05d3ec26-5f9a-4f93-9952-8c9197152b19), featuring the eminent [Emeritus Professor Peter Cameron](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/pjc20/) and my colleague [Dr Walter Pedriali](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/people/gbp1/) on one side, and on the other, [Dr David Waszek](https://www.normalesup.org/~waszek/en/) (an historian and philosopher of mathematics working at the ÉNS in Paris), and me. 

The proposition at issue was officially phrased as “this house believes that mathematics is a human invention rather than a discovery”, but the *advertised* title was the rather more inflammatory “this house believes that maths is <caps>fake</caps>.” David and I had the pleasure of arguing *for* the proposition, while Walter and Peter argued *against*. 

There were over 200 people in attendance, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable evening. I got to exercise some muscles I rarely work with, so it was stretching for me, and the audience seemed to enjoy themselves, too. David and I lost the public vote (by not a small margin—we managed to sway only around 40% of the audience), but I think we made a good showing for ourselves.

If you'd like to see for yourselves, the evening was recorded and can be seen here:
