A few months ago, Anna Day, Eloise Hickey, Mark Rothery, and James Cafferky from the [Undergraduate Philosophy Journal of Australasia](https://upja.online/) asked me lots of questions and gave me an opportunity to ramble on about my early days as a mathematics and philosophy student at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au) in the 1980s and 1990s, my current research interests, and what I'm thinking about now. They asked thoughtful questions and managed to edit the interview down to [something coherent to read](https://upja.online/a-conversation-with-greg-restall/). 

[Check it out](https://upja.online/a-conversation-with-greg-restall/), if only for the photos of me in my teens and twenties, then stay for the philosophy.
