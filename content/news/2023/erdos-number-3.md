According to the [AMS](https://ams.org/)'s handy [Mathematics Collaboration Distance calculator](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html?group_source=328105), my Erdős number is down to _three_, given the following path:

* Vedran Čačić, **Pavel Pudlák**, **Greg Restall**, Alasdair Urquhart, Albert Visser, &ldquo;[Decorated linear order types and the theory of concatenation](https://consequently.org/writing/dlot/),&rdquo; _Logic Colloquium 2007_, p. 1–13, ed. F. Delon, U. Kohlenbach, P. Maddy and F. Stephan, Cambridge University Press, 2010. 
* **Noga Alon** and **Pavel Pudlák**, &ldquo;[Equilateral Sets in $l^n_p$](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00039-003-0418-7),&rdquo; _Geometric &amp; Functional Analysis_, 13 (2003), 467-482.

This makes my Erdős number equal to my Trotsky number, but that is [another story](https://consequently.org/news/2005/08/01/logic_colloquium_2005_day_4/).
