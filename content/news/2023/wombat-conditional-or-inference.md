As my colleague and <span class="caps">[PY1012 Reasoning](/class/2023/py1012)</span> co-lecturer, [Franz Berto](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/people/fb96) knows, it's never too early to introduce your students to wombats, or to the difference between a conditional and an inference.

	<img src="/images/wombat-conditional-or-inference.jpg" width="80%" alt="A picture of a wombat, superimposed with the text 'Quiz: Conditional or Inference? - The wombat is tired, so she will be irritable if provoked,' with the first phrase 'The wombat is tired' encircled and annotated as the premise, the 'so', recording the inference, and 'she will be irritable if provoked' as the conclusion. These annotations are all in yellow. Then, in green, the conclusion is separately annotated, with 'she will be irritable' marked as the consequent, the 'if' marked as indicating that this is a conditional, and 'provoked' marked as the antecedent. Finally, this antecedent is spelled out, in blue, as 'She is provoked'.">
