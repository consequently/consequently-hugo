In my <span class="caps">[PY1012 Reasoning](/class/2023/py1012)</span> lecture this evening, I used a slide with a photo of [Sally Haslanger](https://philosophy.mit.edu/haslanger/) and a short section from her book _[Resisting Reality](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199892631.001.0001)_ to give an example of an argument to a universal generalisation. (I've been teaching reasoning using examples from throughout the philosophical canon.) 

After class a young student came up to me, all excited, asking: _do you know Professor Haslanger_!? (I had described her as a colleague.) I explained that yes, we’d met and I’d known her for some time.  She reacted as if I had been in the presence of a _rock star_, and that she was now a little bit closer to true greatness as a result. When I said I loved Sally’s work, and then added that *[Kate Manne](http://www.katemanne.net)* had been a student of mine at the University of Melbourne before she went to MIT to study with Sally, the student was absolutely beside herself. 

It's a delight exploit my own personal contacts with colleagues and friends, to help a student feel a little closer to what she truly treasures in the sometimes humdrum matter of teaching intro reasoning.
