2022 has been another big year, not that you'd know it from looking around the [news section](/news/) of this website. Settling in to [St Andrews](http://st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/) has taken up a lot of my energy ([in](/class/2021/py4612/) [a](/class/2022/py4634/) [good](/class/2022/py1012) [way](/class/2022/py4638)), and I've been having too much fun [writing](/writing/qjrid/) [things](/writing/contradictions-in-theology/) and [giving talks](/presentation/) to spend time updating this website. 

With the break between Christmas and New Year, I finally had time to clean up a bit of the mess around here, and update things.

The template files I was using were incompatible with recent versions of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), so I needed to take things apart and put things back together, because the build process was beginning to break. If you rely on any software, it makes sense to check in every so often, to make sure that you're staying relatively up-to-date. If you're stuck on an old version, you're running on borrowed time unless you control _the entire stack_. In the case of software running on the network, you _don't_. Keeping your own content on the web requires maintenance and a little bit of care and feeding every so often.

Given that I was digging around and fixing things, I took the opportunity to clean up and refresh the [publications page](/writing/), to highlight the books, since one long list of publications isn't that accessible. Please [let me know](https://scholar.social/@consequently) if anything looks weird or broke in the process.

With the débâcle of Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, I've weaned myself off that platform, so it made sense to remove the mentions of that account as a place to contact me. If you *really* want to see me elsewhere online, it's best to try [@consequently@scholar.social](https://scholar.social/@consequently).
