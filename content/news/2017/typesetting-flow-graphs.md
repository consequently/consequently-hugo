In a few [recent](http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/) [papers](http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/) [and](http://consequently.org/presentation/2017/a-category-of-classical-proofs-tacl/) [talks](http://consequently.org/presentation/2017/proof-identity-invariants-and-hyperintensionality/), I've been using *flow graphs* to display the flow of information in proofs. These are the kinds of things that are easy to draw, but they're not so straightforward to typeset.

Here's an example:

	<figcaption>A flow graph on a natural deduction proof.</figcaption>
</figure>
Thankfully, the tools to typset flow graphs are readily available, at least if you use [LaTeX](http://tug.org). I've written up a little document explaining how to do this, and the document and source are now [available on Github](https://github.com/consequently/flowgraphs) for you to use as you see fit. If you've got any questions, feedback or recommendations for how to extend the technique, please don't hesitate to get in touch. 

I hope it's helpful.
